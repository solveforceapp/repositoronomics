    <h1>Anaplerotic Reaction</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An anaplerotic reaction is a metabolic process that replenishes intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs or citric acid cycle. These reactions are essential for maintaining the cycle's function, supporting energy production, biosynthesis, and cellular homeostasis. Common anaplerotic reactions include the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate and the metabolism of amino acids.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, anaplerotic reactions are targeted to optimize metabolic pathways for the production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals. In neurotechnology, these reactions are studied for their roles in brain energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and the response to injury or disease. Techniques such as metabolic flux analysis, isotope tracing, and genetic engineering are used to investigate and manipulate anaplerotic reactions for research and industrial applications. Advances in systems biology and metabolic engineering continue to expand our understanding and utilization of these critical processes.</p>
