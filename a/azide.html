      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, azides are used for bioconjugation, drug development, and the synthesis of complex molecules. Click chemistry involving azides enables the efficient and selective labeling of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules for imaging, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications. In neurotechnology, azides are used to study mitochondrial function, inhibit specific enzymes, and develop targeted delivery systems. Safety precautions are essential when handling azides due to their potential toxicity and explosiveness. Advances in chemical biology, materials science, and synthetic chemistry continue to expand the utility of azides in research and medicine.</p>
