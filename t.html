      <h1>T Terms</h1>
      <h2>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</h2>
      <p>TCP/IP is the foundational suite of communication protocols used for the internet and most modern networks. It enables reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between devices, supporting everything from web browsing to email and file transfers.</p>
      <h2>Terabyte (TB)</h2>
      <p>A terabyte is a unit of digital information equal to 1,024 gigabytes (GB). Terabytes are commonly used to measure storage capacity in hard drives, SSDs, and cloud storage solutions.</p>
      <h2>Thin Client</h2>
      <p>A thin client is a lightweight computer that relies on a central server for processing and storage. Thin clients are used in virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments for cost-effective, secure, and manageable computing.</p>
      <h2>Token Ring</h2>
      <p>Token Ring is a local area network (LAN) protocol where devices are connected in a ring topology and data is transmitted using a token-passing method. Token Ring was widely used before Ethernet became the dominant LAN technology.</p>
      <h2>Topology</h2>
      <p>Topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices and connections in a network. Common topologies include star, bus, ring, and mesh, each with unique advantages for scalability and reliability.</p>
      <h2>Trojan Horse</h2>
      <p>A Trojan horse is a type of malicious software that disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installing it. Once activated, Trojans can steal data, install other malware, or give attackers remote access to systems.</p>
      <h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
      <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different forms of identification to access a system. 2FA enhances security by combining something you know (password) with something you have (token or device).</p>
      <h2>Teraflop</h2>
      <p>A teraflop is a measure of a computer’s performance, representing one trillion floating-point operations per second. Teraflops are used to quantify the processing power of supercomputers, GPUs, and high-performance systems.</p>
      <h2>Terminal Emulator</h2>
      <p>A terminal emulator is software that replicates the functionality of a traditional computer terminal, allowing users to access command-line interfaces and remote systems from modern computers.</p>
      <h2>Transceiver</h2>
      <p>A transceiver is a device that both transmits and receives signals, used in networking, telecommunications, and radio communications. Transceivers enable bidirectional communication between devices and networks.</p>
