      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A bacterium is a single-celled, prokaryotic microorganism that lacks a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria are found in virtually every environment on Earth and play essential roles in nutrient cycling, disease, and biotechnology. They exhibit diverse shapes, metabolic capabilities, and genetic adaptability, making them important model organisms and tools in scientific research.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, bacteria are used for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, biofuels, and recombinant proteins. In neurotechnology, bacteria are studied for their interactions with the nervous system, particularly through the gut-brain axis and the influence of the microbiome on brain health. Advances in genomics, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering continue to expand the applications of bacteria in medicine, agriculture, and industry.</p>
