      <h1>Bypass</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Bypass refers to the act of circumventing a system, device, or security control, often to maintain functionality or gain unauthorized access. In networking, it can mean routing traffic around a failed or restricted component.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bypass techniques are used in network design for redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring continuous service during failures. In cybersecurity, bypassing security controls is a common attack method, making robust defense mechanisms essential to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
