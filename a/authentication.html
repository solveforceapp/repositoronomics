      <h1>Authentication</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Authentication is a foundational security process in IT, telecom, and cybersecurity that verifies the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to resources or services. The primary objective of authentication is to ensure that only legitimate, authorized entities can interact with sensitive data, applications, or networks. Authentication can be based on something you know (passwords, PINs), something you have (security tokens, smart cards), or something you are (biometrics such as fingerprints or facial recognition). In modern digital environments, authentication is not limited to users; it also applies to devices, applications, and APIs, all of which must prove their identity to establish trust. The strength of authentication mechanisms is a critical factor in defending against cyber threats such as phishing, credential theft, and unauthorized access. As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, organizations are increasingly adopting multi-factor authentication (MFA), which combines two or more independent credentials to enhance security.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Authentication is ubiquitous in today’s digital world, underpinning everything from online banking and e-commerce to enterprise network access and cloud services. For example, when a user logs into a corporate VPN, the system may require a password (something known) and a one-time code from a mobile app (something possessed), providing layered protection against unauthorized entry. In telecom, authentication protocols such as SIM-based authentication ensure that only registered devices can access cellular networks. In the context of APIs and machine-to-machine communication, authentication tokens and certificates validate the identity of applications and services. The adoption of biometric authentication is growing rapidly, offering convenience and enhanced security for mobile devices and secure facilities. Organizations must balance security with user experience, implementing authentication methods that are both robust and user-friendly. As threats evolve, continuous authentication—where user behavior is monitored in real time—may become the norm, providing adaptive security that responds to changing risk levels.</p>
