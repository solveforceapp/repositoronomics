    <h1>Absolute Humidity</h1>

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Absolute humidity is a measure of the actual amount of water vapor present in a given volume of air, typically expressed in grams per cubic meter (g/m³). Unlike relative humidity, which compares the current moisture level to the maximum possible at a given temperature, absolute humidity provides a direct quantification of water vapor content. This parameter is crucial in biotechnology and neurotechnology for maintaining controlled environments in laboratories, greenhouses, and clean rooms, where precise humidity levels are necessary for optimal biological processes, equipment performance, and experimental reproducibility.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, absolute humidity is monitored and regulated to ensure the viability of cell cultures, the stability of reagents, and the accuracy of analytical instruments. In neurotechnology, controlled humidity is essential for the preservation of neural tissue samples, the operation of sensitive electronic devices, and the comfort of subjects in experimental settings. Environmental chambers, incubators, and climate control systems are equipped with sensors to measure and adjust absolute humidity, supporting research in genomics, proteomics, and brain science. Advances in sensor technology and automation have improved the precision and reliability of humidity control, enabling more sophisticated experiments and applications in life sciences.</p>
