      <h1>N Terms</h1>
      <h2>NAT (Network Address Translation)</h2>
      <p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used in routers to modify network address information in IP packet headers. NAT enables multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address, improving security and conserving address space.</p>
      <h2>NAS (Network Attached Storage)</h2>
      <p>Network Attached Storage (NAS) is a dedicated file storage device that provides centralized data access to multiple users and devices over a network. NAS systems are used for backup, file sharing, and scalable storage solutions in homes and businesses.</p>
      <h2>Network Interface Card (NIC)</h2>
      <p>A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. NICs can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi), enabling communication and data transfer between devices.</p>
      <h2>Node</h2>
      <p>A node is any device or point of connection within a network, such as computers, servers, switches, or sensors. Nodes are fundamental to network topology and communication.</p>
      <h2>Non-Volatile Memory</h2>
      <p>Non-volatile memory retains stored data even when power is removed. Examples include flash memory, SSDs, and ROM. Non-volatile memory is essential for persistent data storage in computers and electronic devices.</p>
      <h2>Notebook Computer</h2>
      <p>A notebook computer, or laptop, is a portable personal computer with integrated display, keyboard, and battery. Notebooks offer mobility, performance, and connectivity for work, study, and entertainment.</p>
      <h2>Network Topology</h2>
      <p>Network topology refers to the arrangement of devices and connections in a network. Common topologies include star, bus, ring, and mesh, each with advantages for scalability, reliability, and performance.</p>
      <h2>Near Field Communication (NFC)</h2>
      <p>Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that enables data exchange between devices within a few centimeters. NFC is used in contactless payments, access control, and device pairing.</p>
      <h2>Network Security</h2>
      <p>Network security encompasses policies, practices, and technologies designed to protect data, devices, and systems from unauthorized access, attacks, and breaches. Firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection are key components of network security.</p>
      <h2>Null Modem</h2>
      <p>A null modem is a communication method that connects two computers directly using a serial cable, allowing data transfer without modems or network infrastructure. Null modems are used for legacy systems and troubleshooting.</p>
