    <h1>Autoradiography</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Autoradiography is a technique that uses radioactive isotopes to visualize the distribution of molecules or structures within a biological sample. Samples are exposed to a photographic film or detector, which records the pattern of radioactivity. Autoradiography is widely used in biotechnology and neurotechnology to study gene expression, protein localization, and metabolic activity in tissues and cells.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, autoradiography is used to track the incorporation of labeled nucleotides, amino acids, or drugs into biological molecules. In neurotechnology, it is employed to map neural circuits, study neurotransmitter systems, and investigate brain metabolism. Techniques such as in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and PET imaging are often combined with autoradiography for comprehensive analysis. Advances in imaging technology, radiochemistry, and data analysis continue to enhance the sensitivity and resolution of autoradiography for research and clinical applications.</p>
