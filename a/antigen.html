      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An antigen is any substance that is recognized by the immune system as foreign and capable of eliciting an immune response. Antigens can be proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, or nucleic acids derived from pathogens, allergens, or transplanted tissues. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, antigens are studied for their roles in immunity, disease, and the development of diagnostics and vaccines.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, antigens are used to develop vaccines, diagnostic tests, and immunotherapies. In neurotechnology, antigens are investigated for their involvement in neuroinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Techniques such as antigen presentation assays, epitope mapping, and molecular modeling are used to study antigen structure and function. Advances in vaccine technology, synthetic biology, and immunology continue to expand the applications of antigens in medicine and research.</p>
