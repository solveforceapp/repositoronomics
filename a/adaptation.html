      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Adaptation is the process by which organisms, cells, or systems adjust to changes in their environment to maintain function and survival. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, adaptation can refer to genetic, physiological, or behavioral changes that enhance performance or resilience. Adaptation is a key concept in evolution, sensory processing, and the development of artificial systems that mimic biological flexibility.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, adaptation is studied in the context of microbial resistance, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. In neurotechnology, adaptation mechanisms are explored to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces, neuroprosthetics, and rehabilitation strategies. Understanding adaptation informs the design of systems that can learn, self-correct, and function in dynamic environments. Advances in genomics, computational modeling, and machine learning continue to expand our ability to harness adaptation for medical, industrial, and research applications.</p>
