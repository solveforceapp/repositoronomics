      <h2>Hard Drive</h2>
      <p>A hard drive is a data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information. Hard drives are essential components in computers, servers, and data centers, offering large storage capacities and persistent data retention. Modern alternatives include solid-state drives (SSDs), which offer faster speeds and greater durability.</p>
      <h2>Hash Function</h2>
      <p>A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts input data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically for security or data integrity purposes. Hash functions are used in cryptography, digital signatures, and data indexing.</p>
      <h2>HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)</h2>
      <p>HDMI is a digital interface standard for transmitting high-definition audio and video signals between devices such as computers, TVs, and monitors. HDMI supports high resolutions, multiple audio channels, and copy protection.</p>
      <h2>Host</h2>
      <p>A host is any device or computer connected to a network that provides resources, services, or data to other devices. In web hosting, a host refers to a server that stores and serves website content to users on the internet.</p>
      <h2>Hotspot</h2>
