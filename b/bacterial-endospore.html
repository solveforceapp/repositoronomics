<h1>Bacterial Endospore</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>A bacterial endospore is a highly resistant, dormant structure formed by certain bacteria, such as Bacillus and Clostridium species, in response to adverse environmental conditions. Endospores can withstand extreme heat, desiccation, radiation, and chemical exposure, allowing bacteria to survive until favorable conditions return. Endospore formation is a complex, regulated process involving the synthesis of protective layers and metabolic dormancy.</p>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <p>In biotechnology, bacterial endospores are studied for their roles in food safety, sterilization, and the development of probiotics and vaccines. In neurotechnology, endospores are investigated for their potential to deliver therapeutics to the gut-brain axis and modulate neural function through microbiome interactions. Advances in microbiology, molecular genetics, and materials science continue to expand the applications of bacterial endospores in research, industry, and medicine.</p>
