      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Beta testing is a phase in software development where a product is released to a limited audience outside the development team for real-world use and feedback. It helps identify bugs, usability issues, and areas for improvement before the final release.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Beta testing is used by software companies to gather feedback from actual users, ensuring the product meets user needs and works in diverse environments. It is a critical step for quality assurance and customer satisfaction.</p>
