      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides or proteins produced by bacteria that inhibit the growth of closely related or competing bacterial strains. They are diverse in structure, mode of action, and spectrum of activity. Bacteriocins play important roles in microbial competition, population dynamics, and the maintenance of microbial communities in natural and engineered environments.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, bacteriocins are used as natural preservatives in food, alternatives to antibiotics, and tools for studying microbial ecology. In neurotechnology, bacteriocins are explored for their potential to modulate the gut microbiome and influence brain health through the gut-brain axis. Advances in genomics, synthetic biology, and protein engineering continue to expand the applications of bacteriocins in medicine, agriculture, and industry.</p>
