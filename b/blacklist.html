      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A blacklist (or block list) is a basic access control mechanism that denies access to specific users, devices, or data while allowing all others. It is commonly used in security systems, email filtering, and network management to block unwanted or harmful entities.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Blacklists are used to prevent spam, block malicious IP addresses, and restrict access to unauthorized resources. They are essential in cybersecurity, helping organizations protect systems and data from known threats and unwanted activity.</p>
