      <h1>S Terms</h1>
      <h2>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h2>
      <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model where software applications are delivered over the internet as a service. Users access SaaS applications via web browsers, eliminating the need for local installation and simplifying updates and maintenance.</p>
      <h2>Scalability</h2>
      <p>Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or application to handle increased workload or growth without compromising performance. Scalable solutions are essential for businesses anticipating expansion or fluctuating demand.</p>
      <h2>SDN (Software-Defined Networking)</h2>
      <p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatic control of network resources. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, improving flexibility, automation, and efficiency.</p>
      <h2>Server</h2>
      <p>A server is a computer or software system that provides resources, data, or services to other computers (clients) over a network. Servers are the backbone of the internet, hosting websites, applications, and databases.</p>
      <h2>SIM Card</h2>
      <p>A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is a small chip used in mobile devices to store user identity, authentication, and network information. SIM cards enable secure access to cellular networks and support features like roaming and mobile payments.</p>
      <h2>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</h2>
      <p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending email messages between servers. SMTP is a core component of email infrastructure, enabling reliable and efficient message delivery.</p>
      <h2>SQL (Structured Query Language)</h2>
      <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL enables data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion, and is fundamental to data-driven applications.</p>
      <h2>SSH (Secure Shell)</h2>
      <p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure remote access and management of computers. SSH provides encrypted communication, authentication, and command execution over insecure networks.</p>
      <h2>Storage Area Network (SAN)</h2>
      <p>A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a high-speed network that provides access to consolidated, block-level storage. SANs are used in data centers for scalable, reliable, and high-performance storage solutions.</p>
      <h2>Switch</h2>
      <p>A switch is a network device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and forwards data based on MAC addresses. Switches improve network efficiency, reduce collisions, and support VLAN segmentation.</p>
