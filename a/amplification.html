    <h1>Amplification</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Amplification refers to the process of increasing the quantity or strength of a signal, molecule, or biological response. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, amplification is commonly used to describe the replication of DNA or RNA (as in polymerase chain reaction, PCR), the enhancement of electrical signals in neural circuits, or the upregulation of gene expression. Amplification is essential for detecting, analyzing, and manipulating biological systems.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, amplification techniques such as PCR, qPCR, and isothermal amplification are used for diagnostics, cloning, and genetic analysis. In neurotechnology, amplification of neural signals is critical for the development of brain-computer interfaces, neural prosthetics, and electrophysiological recording devices. Advances in nanotechnology, electronics, and molecular biology continue to improve amplification methods, enabling more sensitive, accurate, and scalable applications in research, medicine, and industry.</p>
