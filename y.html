      <h1>Y Terms</h1>
      <h2>Y2K (Year 2000 Problem)</h2>
      <p>The Y2K problem, also known as the Millennium Bug, was a computer flaw that arose because many systems represented years with only two digits. As the year 2000 approached, concerns grew that systems would interpret "00" as 1900, potentially causing errors in calculations, data storage, and operations. Extensive remediation efforts prevented major disruptions.</p>
      <h2>Yagi Antenna</h2>
      <p>A Yagi antenna is a directional antenna commonly used for television reception, amateur radio, and wireless communications. It consists of multiple parallel elements and provides high gain and directivity.</p>
      <h2>YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)</h2>
      <p>YAML is a human-readable data serialization format used for configuration files, data exchange, and automation scripts. YAML is popular in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and application deployment.</p>
      <h2>Yellow Pages (YP)</h2>
      <p>Yellow Pages is a directory service that lists businesses and organizations, traditionally in print and now online. In computing, YP refers to a network information service for managing distributed directories in UNIX systems.</p>
      <h2>Yield</h2>
      <p>In programming, yield is a keyword used in generators and coroutines to produce a value and pause execution, resuming later. Yield enables efficient iteration and asynchronous programming in languages like Python and JavaScript.</p>
      <h2>Yottabyte (YB)</h2>
      <p>A yottabyte is a unit of digital information equal to 1,024 zettabytes, or approximately one septillion bytes. Yottabytes are used to measure massive data volumes in cloud computing, big data, and scientific research.</p>
      <h2>YUV</h2>
      <p>YUV is a color encoding system used in video and image processing, separating brightness (Y) from color information (U and V). YUV is widely used in television broadcasting, video compression, and digital imaging.</p>
      <h2>Yagi-Uda Array</h2>
      <p>The Yagi-Uda array is another term for the Yagi antenna, emphasizing its inventor. It is valued for its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to focus radio waves in a specific direction.</p>
      <h2>Yarn</h2>
      <p>Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that helps developers manage project dependencies, automate tasks, and ensure consistent builds. Yarn is an alternative to npm and is widely used in web development.</p>
      <h2>Yield Curve</h2>
      <p>In finance and data analysis, a yield curve is a graph that plots interest rates or returns over different time periods. In technology, yield curves can be used to analyze performance, trends, and resource allocation.</p>
