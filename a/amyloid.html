      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Amyloid refers to insoluble fibrous protein aggregates that form in tissues and organs, often associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Amyloid fibrils are characterized by a beta-sheet-rich structure and can disrupt cellular function, leading to cell death and tissue damage. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, amyloid formation is studied to understand disease mechanisms, develop diagnostics, and design therapeutic interventions.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, amyloid imaging and biomarker analysis are used for early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. Techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry are employed to detect and quantify amyloid deposits. In biotechnology, research focuses on developing drugs and antibodies that prevent or reverse amyloid aggregation. Advances in structural biology, molecular modeling, and high-throughput screening are driving the discovery of new therapeutic targets and strategies for amyloid-related diseases.</p>
