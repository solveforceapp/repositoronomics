    <h1>File Integrity Monitoring</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a security process that checks and verifies the integrity of operating system and application software files by comparing the current state to a known, trusted baseline. FIM detects unauthorized changes, additions, or deletions, which may indicate a security breach or malware infection.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>FIM is widely used in compliance-driven industries such as finance and healthcare. For example, a FIM solution can alert administrators if critical system files are altered, helping to prevent data breaches and maintain regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA).</p>
