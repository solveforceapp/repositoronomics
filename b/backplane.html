      <h1>Backplane</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A backplane is a circuit board containing sockets (slots) into which other circuit boards can be plugged. It serves as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete computer system or to expand its capabilities. Backplanes are commonly used in servers, routers, and industrial computers to provide a modular and scalable architecture.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Backplanes are essential in systems that require high reliability and easy maintenance, such as telecommunications equipment, data centers, and industrial automation. They allow for hot-swapping of components, easy upgrades, and flexible system expansion without the need for extensive rewiring or downtime.</p>
