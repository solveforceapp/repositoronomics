      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Beta-glucan is a polysaccharide composed of glucose molecules linked by beta-glycosidic bonds. It is found in the cell walls of cereals, bacteria, fungi, and yeast. Beta-glucans have diverse structures and biological activities, including immune modulation, cholesterol reduction, and prebiotic effects. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, beta-glucans are studied for their health benefits and applications in food, medicine, and research.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, beta-glucans are used as dietary supplements, functional food ingredients, and immunomodulators. They are also employed in drug delivery systems, wound healing, and vaccine adjuvants. In neurotechnology, beta-glucans are investigated for their potential to modulate neuroinflammation, support cognitive function, and influence the gut-brain axis. Advances in bioprocessing, molecular biology, and clinical research continue to expand the applications of beta-glucans in health and disease management.</p>
