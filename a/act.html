      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An act, in the context of biotechnology and neurotechnology, refers to a formal law, regulation, or legislative measure enacted by a governing body to regulate activities, standards, or ethical practices within these fields. Acts establish legal frameworks for research, development, commercialization, and the use of biotechnological and neurotechnological innovations. They address issues such as safety, intellectual property, privacy, clinical trials, and the ethical treatment of humans and animals in scientific research.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Acts play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of biotechnology and neurotechnology by setting standards for product approval, research conduct, and public health protection. Examples include the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. Compliance with relevant acts ensures that organizations operate within legal and ethical boundaries, fostering public trust and facilitating the responsible advancement of science and technology. Ongoing legislative updates reflect the evolving nature of these fields and the need to address emerging challenges and opportunities.</p>
