      <h1>Bare Metal</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, "bare metal" describes a computational or hardware environment where software runs directly on physical hardware, without the abstraction of an operating system or virtualization layer. This approach provides direct, low-level access to hardware resources, enabling maximum performance, real-time control, and precise timing—features critical for certain experimental setups, medical devices, and high-throughput data acquisition systems. In neurotechnology, bare metal systems are often used in custom neural recording and stimulation devices, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and embedded systems for closed-loop neuromodulation, where latency and reliability are paramount. The term can also refer to the initial, uncoated state of implantable medical devices, such as stents or electrodes, before any biocompatible coatings or functionalizations are applied.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bare metal computing environments are essential in biotechnology and neurotechnology for applications that demand deterministic performance, minimal overhead, and direct hardware control. In neurotechnology, custom neural interfaces and implantable devices often rely on bare metal firmware to achieve real-time signal processing, artifact rejection, and adaptive stimulation. This is crucial for research in brain-machine interfaces, epilepsy monitoring, and deep brain stimulation, where precise timing can affect experimental outcomes and patient safety. In biotechnology, bare metal systems are used in high-throughput laboratory automation, robotics, and custom instrumentation for genomics, proteomics, and cell sorting. Additionally, the concept of bare metal is relevant to the development of implantable devices, where the interaction between the uncoated metal surface and biological tissues influences biocompatibility, integration, and long-term function. Advances in materials science, embedded systems engineering, and regulatory standards continue to shape the use of bare metal in both computational and biomedical contexts, driving innovation in research tools, medical devices, and therapeutic technologies.</p>
