    <h1>Fax over IP</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Fax over IP (FoIP) is a technology that enables the transmission of fax documents over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the internet or private IP-based networks. It replaces traditional analog phone lines with digital communication, using protocols like T.38 or G.711 to ensure reliable fax delivery.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>FoIP is used by businesses to integrate faxing into their unified communications systems, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. For example, a company can send and receive faxes directly from email or document management systems, eliminating the need for physical fax machines and dedicated phone lines.</p>
