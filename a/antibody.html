      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An antibody, or immunoglobulin, is a Y-shaped protein produced by B cells of the immune system in response to foreign substances called antigens. Antibodies recognize and bind to specific antigens, neutralizing pathogens or marking them for destruction by other immune cells. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, antibodies are essential tools for diagnostics, therapeutics, and research applications.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, antibodies are used in assays such as ELISA, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to detect and quantify biomolecules. Therapeutic antibodies are developed to treat diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. In neurotechnology, antibodies are used to study neural proteins, map brain circuits, and develop targeted therapies for neurological conditions. Advances in antibody engineering, such as monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, are expanding the range of applications and improving the efficacy of antibody-based treatments.</p>
