      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Acoustics is the scientific study of sound, including its production, transmission, and effects on materials and living organisms. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, acoustics encompasses the analysis of auditory systems, the development of hearing aids and cochlear implants, and the use of ultrasound for imaging and therapy. The field integrates principles from physics, engineering, biology, and neuroscience to understand and manipulate sound in biological and technological contexts.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, acoustics is applied in laboratory instrumentation, cell manipulation, and the design of biosensors. In neurotechnology, it underpins the development of auditory prosthetics, brain-computer interfaces, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. Acoustic waves are also used for targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the study of neural responses to sound. Advances in acoustic technology are expanding the capabilities of diagnostics, therapeutics, and research tools in life sciences and brain research.</p>
