      <h1>Q Terms</h1>
      <h2>QoS (Quality of Service)</h2>
      <p>Quality of Service (QoS) refers to technologies and techniques used to manage network traffic and ensure the performance of critical applications. QoS prioritizes certain types of data, reduces latency, and guarantees bandwidth for voice, video, and real-time services.</p>
      <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
      <p>Quantum computing is an emerging field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Quantum computers use qubits, which can represent multiple states simultaneously, enabling breakthroughs in cryptography, optimization, and simulation.</p>
      <h2>Query</h2>
      <p>A query is a request for information from a database or information system. Queries are written in languages like SQL and are fundamental to data retrieval, reporting, and analytics.</p>
      <h2>Queue</h2>
      <p>A queue is a data structure or process that stores and manages items in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. Queues are used in programming, networking, and operating systems for task scheduling and resource management.</p>
      <h2>Quick Response (QR) Code</h2>
      <p>A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that stores information such as URLs, contact details, or payment data. QR codes are widely used for mobile payments, marketing, and inventory management due to their fast readability and versatility.</p>
      <h2>Quarantine</h2>
      <p>Quarantine in cybersecurity refers to isolating files, devices, or network segments to prevent the spread of malware or threats. Antivirus software and network security tools use quarantine to contain and remediate infections.</p>
      <h2>Qubit</h2>
      <p>A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information in quantum computing. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling powerful parallel processing and new computational paradigms.</p>
      <h2>QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)</h2>
      <p>Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is a modulation technique used in digital telecommunications to transmit data by varying the amplitude of two carrier waves. QAM is used in cable modems, digital TV, and wireless communications.</p>
      <h2>QoE (Quality of Experience)</h2>
      <p>Quality of Experience (QoE) measures the overall satisfaction of users with a service or application, considering factors like performance, reliability, and usability. QoE is important for optimizing customer experience in telecom and IT services.</p>
      <h2>Quota</h2>
      <p>A quota is a limit set on the amount of resources, such as storage, bandwidth, or processing power, that a user or application can consume. Quotas help manage resources, prevent abuse, and ensure fair usage in shared environments.</p>
