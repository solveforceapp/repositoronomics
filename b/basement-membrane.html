    <h1>Basement Membrane</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>The basement membrane is a thin, specialized layer of extracellular matrix that underlies and supports epithelial and endothelial cells. It provides structural support, regulates cell behavior, and acts as a barrier to the movement of cells and molecules. The basement membrane is composed of proteins such as collagen, laminin, and proteoglycans, and plays essential roles in tissue development, repair, and homeostasis.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, the basement membrane is studied for its roles in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cancer research. In neurotechnology, the basement membrane is important for the development and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, neural stem cell niches, and the integration of neural implants. Advances in biomaterials, imaging, and molecular biology continue to expand the applications of the basement membrane in science and medicine.</p>
