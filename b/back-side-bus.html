      <h1>Back-side Bus</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>The back-side bus is a computer bus used to connect the CPU to its cache memory, typically the L2 cache. It operates at a higher speed than the front-side bus and is dedicated to communication between the processor and cache, improving overall system performance.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Back-side buses are found in older computer architectures where separate buses were used for cache and main memory. They enabled faster data transfer between the CPU and cache, reducing latency and increasing processing speed in high-performance systems.</p>
