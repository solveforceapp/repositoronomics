      <h2>Failover</h2>
      <p>Failover is a backup operational mode in which the functions of a system component (such as a server, network, or database) are automatically assumed by secondary components when the primary component fails. This ensures high availability and business continuity, minimizing downtime and data loss. Failover mechanisms are critical in mission-critical systems, cloud services, and enterprise IT infrastructure.</p>
      <h2>Fiber Optics</h2>
      <p>Fiber optics is a technology that transmits data as pulses of light through strands of glass or plastic fibers. It offers high bandwidth, low latency, and immunity to electromagnetic interference, making it the backbone of modern telecommunications, internet backbones, and data centers. Fiber optic networks enable gigabit and terabit speeds over long distances.</p>
      <h2>Firewall</h2>
      <p>A firewall is a security system—either hardware, software, or a combination—that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls protect networks from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and data breaches, and are a fundamental component of cybersecurity strategies.</p>
      <h2>Firmware</h2>
      <p>Firmware is specialized software programmed into hardware devices to control their functions. It provides low-level control for devices such as routers, printers, and embedded systems. Firmware updates can fix bugs, add features, or enhance security, and are essential for device reliability and performance.</p>
      <h2>Flash Memory</h2>
      <p>Flash memory is a type of non-volatile storage that retains data without power. It is widely used in USB drives, SSDs, memory cards, and mobile devices due to its speed, durability, and compact size. Flash memory has revolutionized data storage, enabling portable and high-capacity solutions.</p>
      <h2>Floating Point</h2>
      <p>Floating point refers to a method of representing real numbers in computing that supports a wide range of values by using a fractional component (mantissa) and an exponent. Floating point arithmetic is essential for scientific computing, graphics, and applications requiring precision and scale.</p>
      <h2>Form Factor</h2>
      <p>Form factor describes the physical size, shape, and layout of hardware components, such as motherboards, hard drives, and servers. Standardized form factors ensure compatibility and interoperability in computer systems and data centers.</p>
      <h2>Fragmentation</h2>
      <p>Fragmentation occurs when storage space is used inefficiently, causing files to be split into non-contiguous blocks. This can slow down data access and degrade system performance. Defragmentation tools reorganize data to improve efficiency.</p>
      <h2>Frame Relay</h2>
      <p>Frame Relay is a high-speed, packet-switching telecommunication service designed for cost-efficient data transmission in wide area networks (WANs). It is used for connecting local area networks (LANs) and transferring data between endpoints.</p>
      <h2>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h2>
      <p>FTP is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers over a TCP/IP network. It is commonly used for website management, data exchange, and remote file access, though secure alternatives like SFTP are now preferred.</p>
