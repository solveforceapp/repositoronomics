      <h1>Biometrics</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Biometrics is the science and technology of measuring and analyzing unique physical and behavioral characteristics of individuals for the purpose of identification and authentication. Common biometric identifiers include fingerprints, facial features, iris and retina patterns, voiceprints, hand geometry, and even behavioral traits such as typing rhythm or gait. In IT, security, and telecommunications, biometrics is increasingly used to verify the identity of users, devices, or systems, providing a higher level of assurance than traditional methods like passwords or PINs. Biometric systems capture, process, and compare biometric data against stored templates to determine a match. The uniqueness and permanence of biometric traits make them difficult to forge or steal, but privacy and data protection are critical concerns, as biometric data is sensitive and, if compromised, cannot be changed like a password. Advances in artificial intelligence and sensor technology have greatly improved the accuracy, speed, and usability of biometric systems, making them a cornerstone of modern security strategies.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Biometric systems are now ubiquitous in both consumer and enterprise environments. Smartphones and laptops use fingerprint scanners and facial recognition for secure, convenient access. Airports and border control agencies deploy biometric gates to verify travelers’ identities, speeding up processing and enhancing security. In banking and financial services, biometrics enable secure authentication for online transactions and ATM access, reducing fraud and identity theft. Healthcare organizations use biometrics to control access to patient records and medication dispensing systems. In the workplace, biometric time and attendance systems prevent “buddy punching” and ensure accurate payroll. Despite their advantages, biometric systems must address challenges such as spoofing (using fake fingerprints or photos), user acceptance, and compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR. Multi-modal biometrics, which combine two or more biometric traits, offer even greater security and reliability. As digital transformation accelerates, biometrics will continue to play a vital role in securing identities, protecting assets, and enabling seamless user experiences across industries.</p>
