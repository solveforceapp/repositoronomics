      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A bytestream is a continuous sequence of bytes transmitted or processed as a single flow. It is a fundamental concept in data communication, file I/O, and network protocols, enabling the transfer of arbitrary data between systems.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bytestreams are used in file transfers, network sockets, and multimedia streaming. They allow for efficient, flexible data handling in applications such as web servers, video streaming, and device communication, supporting both real-time and batch processing.</p>
