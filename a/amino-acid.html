      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Amino acids are organic molecules that serve as the building blocks of proteins. Each amino acid contains an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a unique side chain (R group) attached to a central carbon atom. There are 20 standard amino acids in the genetic code, each with distinct chemical properties that determine protein structure and function. Amino acids are essential for life, playing roles in metabolism, signaling, and the synthesis of biomolecules.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, amino acids are used in protein engineering, metabolic engineering, and the production of pharmaceuticals, food additives, and biomaterials. In neurotechnology, amino acids such as glutamate, GABA, and glycine function as neurotransmitters, mediating communication between neurons. Techniques such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, and genetic engineering are used to study and manipulate amino acids for research and industrial applications. Advances in synthetic biology and systems biology continue to expand the utility of amino acids in science and technology.</p>
