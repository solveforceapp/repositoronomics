      <h1>Bytewise</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Bytewise refers to operations or manipulations performed on data at the byte level, as opposed to bitwise (bit level) or wordwise (word level) operations. It is common in programming, data processing, and hardware interfaces.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bytewise operations are used in tasks such as data serialization, memory management, and communication protocols. They enable efficient handling of data structures, file formats, and device communication in both software and hardware systems.</p>
