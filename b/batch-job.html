      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A batch job is a non-interactive process that is submitted to a computer system or cluster to run without user intervention. It typically involves processing large volumes of data or executing repetitive tasks according to a schedule or queue.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Batch jobs are widely used in data processing, scientific computing, and enterprise IT for automating backups, report generation, and large-scale computations. They improve efficiency by running tasks during off-peak hours or in parallel on multiple machines.</p>
