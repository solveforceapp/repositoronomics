      <h1>J Terms</h1>
      <h2>Java</h2>
      <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for portability, security, and performance. It is widely used for building enterprise applications, mobile apps (Android), and web services. Java’s platform independence is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows code to run on any device with a compatible JVM.</p>
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It runs in browsers and on servers (Node.js), enabling client-side validation, animations, and real-time updates. JavaScript is a cornerstone of modern web development.</p>
      <h2>Jitter</h2>
      <p>Jitter refers to the variation in latency or delay in packet arrival times in a network. High jitter can degrade the quality of real-time applications such as VoIP, video conferencing, and online gaming. Network equipment and protocols often include mechanisms to minimize jitter.</p>
      <h2>JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</h2>
      <p>JPEG is a widely used image compression standard that reduces file size while maintaining acceptable image quality. JPEG images are common on the web, in digital cameras, and in multimedia applications.</p>
      <h2>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</h2>
      <p>JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is widely used in web APIs, configuration files, and data storage.</p>
      <h2>JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)</h2>
      <p>JTAG is a standard for testing and debugging integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. It provides a way to access and control the internal states of chips for diagnostics and programming.</p>
      <h2>JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</h2>
      <p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables Java programs to run on any device or operating system. The JVM interprets compiled Java bytecode and provides features like garbage collection and security.</p>
      <h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>
      <p>Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and research.</p>
      <h2>Junction Box</h2>
      <p>A junction box is an enclosure used to protect and organize electrical connections. In networking, it may refer to a box that houses cable terminations and splices, ensuring safety and reliability.</p>
      <h2>Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation</h2>
      <p>Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a technique where code is compiled into machine language at runtime, rather than before execution. JIT improves performance by optimizing code for the specific environment in which it runs, and is used in Java, .NET, and other platforms.</p>
