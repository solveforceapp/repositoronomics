    <h1>Acute Phase Protein</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Acute phase proteins are a class of proteins whose plasma concentrations increase or decrease in response to inflammation, infection, or injury. Produced primarily by the liver, these proteins play roles in modulating the immune response, promoting tissue repair, and restoring homeostasis. Common acute phase proteins include C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A, and fibrinogen. Their levels are used as biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring inflammatory conditions in clinical and research settings.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, acute phase proteins are used as diagnostic markers for infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Their measurement guides treatment decisions and monitors disease progression. In neurotechnology, acute phase proteins are studied for their roles in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and brain injury. Understanding the regulation and function of these proteins informs the development of therapies for inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Advances in proteomics and biomarker discovery continue to expand the utility of acute phase proteins in personalized medicine and translational research.</p>
