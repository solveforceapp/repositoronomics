      <h1>Backward Compatible</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Backward compatibility is the ability of a system, product, or technology to work with earlier versions of itself or with input designed for such versions. This ensures that new hardware or software can still use data, interfaces, or devices from previous generations.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Backward compatibility is crucial in IT and telecom to protect investments in legacy systems. For example, new operating systems often support older applications, and new hardware interfaces may accept older devices, reducing the need for immediate upgrades.</p>
