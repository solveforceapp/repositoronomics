      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A barebone is a basic computer case or system that includes only the essential components, such as the chassis, power supply, and motherboard, but lacks other parts like storage, memory, or CPU. It allows users to customize and build their own systems by adding the desired components.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Barebone systems are popular among enthusiasts and businesses that require custom configurations. They are used for building servers, workstations, or compact PCs, offering flexibility and cost savings by letting users select only the components they need.</p>
