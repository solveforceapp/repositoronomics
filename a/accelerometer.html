      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An accelerometer is a sensor that measures proper acceleration, the rate of change of velocity experienced by an object. It detects both static forces, like gravity, and dynamic forces, such as movement or vibration. Accelerometers are available in various forms, including mechanical, piezoelectric, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), each suited to different applications. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, accelerometers are essential for monitoring motion, orientation, and impact in biological systems, devices, and experimental setups.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, accelerometers are used in laboratory equipment, wearable health monitors, and robotic systems to track movement, detect falls, and assess physical activity. In neurotechnology, they are integrated into neuroprosthetics, brain-computer interfaces, and rehabilitation devices to monitor patient mobility, control assistive technologies, and study motor function. The data provided by accelerometers support research on balance, gait, and neurological disorders, enabling personalized interventions and improved outcomes. Advances in MEMS technology have made accelerometers smaller, more sensitive, and more affordable, expanding their use in life sciences and brain research.</p>
