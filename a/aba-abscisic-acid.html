    <h1>ABA (Abscisic Acid)</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that plays a critical role in regulating plant growth, development, and stress responses. It is involved in processes such as seed dormancy, stomatal closure, and adaptation to environmental stresses like drought and salinity. ABA acts as a signaling molecule, enabling plants to respond rapidly to changing conditions by modulating gene expression and physiological processes. In biotechnology, ABA is studied for its role in crop engineering, stress tolerance, and the development of resilient agricultural systems.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, ABA is used to develop genetically modified crops with enhanced resistance to environmental stresses, improving yield and sustainability. Researchers manipulate ABA signaling pathways to create plants that can withstand drought, high salinity, or extreme temperatures. In neurotechnology, ABA and its analogs are explored for their potential neuroprotective effects and as tools for studying stress signaling in neural cells. The hormone’s role in cellular signaling and adaptation makes it a valuable target for both agricultural and biomedical research, with implications for food security and human health.</p>
