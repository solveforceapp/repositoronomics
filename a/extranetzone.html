    <h1>Extranet Zone</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>An extranet zone is a segregated segment of a corporate network specifically designated for external access. It is typically protected by firewalls and other security measures to ensure that only authorized external users can access the resources within the zone, while preventing them from reaching the broader internal network. The extranet zone acts as a buffer, reducing the risk of external threats impacting core business systems.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Extranet zones are commonly used in industries that require frequent collaboration with external entities, such as logistics, finance, and healthcare. For example, a logistics company may create an extranet zone for its shipping partners to track deliveries and update shipment statuses, ensuring operational efficiency while maintaining strict security boundaries.</p>
