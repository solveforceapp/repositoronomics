      <h1>K Terms</h1>
      <h2>Kernel</h2>
      <p>The kernel is the core component of an operating system, managing system resources, hardware communication, and process scheduling. It provides the essential interface between software and hardware, ensuring stability, security, and efficient operation. Kernels can be monolithic, microkernel, or hybrid in design.</p>
      <h2>Keylogger</h2>
      <p>A keylogger is a type of surveillance software or hardware that records keystrokes on a computer or device. Keyloggers are used for monitoring, troubleshooting, or, maliciously, for stealing sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.</p>
      <h2>Keystone Jack</h2>
      <p>A keystone jack is a standardized, modular connector used in data and telecommunication networks. It allows for easy installation and customization of network cabling in patch panels, wall plates, and surface mount boxes.</p>
      <h2>Keyword</h2>
      <p>In programming, a keyword is a reserved word that has a predefined meaning in a language’s syntax. Keywords are fundamental to code structure and cannot be used as identifiers. In search engines, keywords are terms used to match queries with relevant content.</p>
      <h2>Kilobyte (KB)</h2>
      <p>A kilobyte is a unit of digital information equal to 1,024 bytes. Kilobytes are used to measure file sizes, memory, and storage capacity in computing systems.</p>
      <h2>KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) Switch</h2>
      <p>A KVM switch is a hardware device that allows a user to control multiple computers from a single keyboard, video monitor, and mouse. KVM switches are used in data centers, server rooms, and multi-system workstations for efficient management.</p>
      <h2>Kubernetes</h2>
      <p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It orchestrates clusters of machines, ensuring high availability, scalability, and resilience for cloud-native workloads.</p>
      <h2>Kerberos</h2>
      <p>Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses secret-key cryptography to provide secure user and service authentication. It is widely used in enterprise networks and operating systems for single sign-on and secure access control.</p>
      <h2>Knowledge Base</h2>
      <p>A knowledge base is a centralized repository of information, documentation, and solutions for users and support teams. Knowledge bases improve self-service, troubleshooting, and organizational learning.</p>
      <h2>Ku Band</h2>
      <p>Ku band is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum used for satellite communications, broadcasting, and data transmission. It enables high-frequency, high-capacity links for television, internet, and enterprise connectivity.</p>
