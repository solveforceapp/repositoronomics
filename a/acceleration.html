    <h1>Acceleration</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Acceleration is the rate at which the velocity of an object changes over time, typically measured in meters per second squared (m/s²). In biotechnology and neurotechnology, acceleration is a key parameter in the design and analysis of motion sensors, laboratory equipment, and biomechanical studies. Understanding acceleration is essential for interpreting the dynamics of biological systems, optimizing experimental protocols, and developing devices that interact with living tissues or organisms.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, acceleration is measured and controlled in centrifuges, shakers, and bioreactors to ensure proper mixing, separation, and growth conditions. In neurotechnology, accelerometers are used in wearable devices, neuroprosthetics, and brain-machine interfaces to monitor movement, detect falls, or control assistive technologies. The study of acceleration also informs research on neural control of movement, balance, and coordination, providing insights into motor disorders and rehabilitation strategies. Advances in sensor technology and data analysis are enhancing the precision and utility of acceleration measurements in life sciences and brain research.</p>
