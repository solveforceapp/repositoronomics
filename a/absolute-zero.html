    <h1>Absolute Zero</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, defined as 0 Kelvin or -273.15°C, at which the motion of all particles theoretically ceases. At this temperature, a system reaches its minimum possible energy state, and entropy is at its lowest. Absolute zero is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and cryogenics, with profound implications for the behavior of matter and energy. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, achieving temperatures near absolute zero enables the preservation of biological samples, the study of quantum phenomena, and the development of advanced imaging and measurement techniques.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, cryogenic storage at temperatures approaching absolute zero is used to preserve cells, tissues, and genetic material for long-term research and therapeutic applications. In neurotechnology, ultra-low temperatures are employed in brain imaging, superconducting sensors, and quantum computing devices. The ability to reach and maintain absolute zero is also critical for experiments in molecular biology, structural biology, and nanotechnology, where thermal motion must be minimized to observe delicate interactions. Advances in refrigeration, vacuum technology, and material science continue to push the boundaries of low-temperature research, opening new frontiers in life sciences and brain research.</p>
