      <h1>Z Terms</h1>
      <h2>Z-Buffer</h2>
      <p>The Z-buffer is a computer graphics technique used to manage image depth coordinates in 3D rendering. It helps determine which objects, or parts of objects, are visible in a scene by storing depth information for each pixel, enabling realistic rendering of overlapping objects.</p>
      <h2>Zettabyte (ZB)</h2>
      <p>A zettabyte is a unit of digital information equal to 1,024 exabytes, or approximately one sextillion bytes. Zettabytes are used to measure massive data volumes in cloud storage, big data analytics, and global internet traffic.</p>
      <h2>Zero-Day</h2>
      <p>A zero-day is a software vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor and has not yet been patched. Zero-day exploits are highly valuable to attackers and pose significant security risks until a fix is released.</p>
      <h2>Zero Trust</h2>
      <p>Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no user or device is inherently trustworthy, requiring continuous verification and strict access controls. Zero Trust architectures help protect against insider threats and advanced cyberattacks.</p>
      <h2>Zigbee</h2>
      <p>Zigbee is a wireless communication protocol designed for low-power, low-data-rate applications such as smart home devices, industrial automation, and IoT networks. Zigbee enables reliable, scalable, and energy-efficient connectivity.</p>
      <h2>Zip File</h2>
      <p>A zip file is a compressed archive format that reduces file size and groups multiple files into a single package. Zip files are widely used for data storage, transfer, and backup, supporting password protection and encryption.</p>
      <h2>Zone File</h2>
      <p>A zone file is a text file used in DNS servers to map domain names to IP addresses and other resources. Zone files are essential for managing domain name systems and ensuring reliable internet navigation.</p>
      <h2>Zoom</h2>
      <p>Zoom is a popular video conferencing platform that enables virtual meetings, webinars, and collaboration. Zoom supports high-quality audio, video, screen sharing, and integrations with productivity tools.</p>
      <h2>Z-Wave</h2>
      <p>Z-Wave is a wireless communication protocol used in home automation for connecting smart devices such as lights, locks, and sensors. Z-Wave networks are known for their reliability, low power consumption, and interoperability.</p>
      <h2>Zettascale Computing</h2>
      <p>Zettascale computing refers to computing systems capable of performing at least one zettaFLOP (10^21 floating-point operations per second). Zettascale systems are the next frontier in high-performance computing, enabling breakthroughs in science, engineering, and artificial intelligence.</p>
