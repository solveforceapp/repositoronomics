    <h1>Fast Ethernet</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Fast Ethernet is a term for Ethernet standards that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 100 megabits per second (Mbps), ten times faster than the original 10 Mbps Ethernet. It includes standards such as 100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX, which use twisted pair or fiber optic cabling, respectively.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Fast Ethernet is widely used in local area networks (LANs) for connecting computers, switches, and routers. It provides sufficient bandwidth for most office applications and is often used as a backbone for small to medium-sized networks. Although Gigabit Ethernet is now more common, Fast Ethernet remains in use for legacy systems and cost-sensitive deployments.</p>
