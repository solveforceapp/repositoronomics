    <h1>Absorption</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Absorption is the process by which matter takes in energy, particles, or substances from its surroundings, resulting in a change in its physical or chemical state. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, absorption commonly refers to the uptake of light, radiation, or chemicals by biological tissues, cells, or materials. This phenomenon underlies many analytical techniques, such as spectroscopy, imaging, and drug delivery, where the efficiency and specificity of absorption determine the effectiveness of detection, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, absorption is fundamental to assays that measure the concentration of biomolecules, the activity of enzymes, or the presence of contaminants. In neurotechnology, absorption properties of brain tissue are exploited in optical imaging, phototherapy, and targeted drug delivery. Understanding and controlling absorption enables the development of advanced diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents, and biosensors. Innovations in nanomaterials, photonics, and molecular engineering continue to enhance the precision and versatility of absorption-based technologies, driving progress in life sciences and brain research.</p>
