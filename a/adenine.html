    <h1>Adenine</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Adenine is a purine nucleobase found in DNA, RNA, and various biomolecules. It pairs with thymine in DNA and with uracil in RNA through hydrogen bonding, playing a critical role in the storage and transmission of genetic information. Adenine is also a component of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and other essential cofactors involved in cellular metabolism and signaling.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, adenine is studied for its roles in gene expression, DNA replication, and metabolic regulation. Techniques such as PCR, DNA sequencing, and gene editing rely on the accurate pairing and manipulation of adenine-containing nucleotides. In neurotechnology, adenine derivatives are investigated for their effects on neural signaling, energy metabolism, and neuroprotection. Advances in synthetic biology, drug design, and molecular diagnostics continue to leverage adenine's properties for research, therapeutic, and industrial applications.</p>
