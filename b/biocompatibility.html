      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Biocompatibility is the ability of a material, device, or substance to perform its intended function in a biological environment without eliciting adverse reactions or toxicity. Biocompatible materials are essential for medical implants, prosthetics, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. The assessment of biocompatibility involves evaluating factors such as cytotoxicity, immunogenicity, and long-term stability.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, biocompatibility is a key consideration in the design and development of medical devices, biomaterials, and tissue scaffolds. In neurotechnology, biocompatibility is critical for the integration and performance of neural implants, electrodes, and brain-computer interfaces. Advances in materials science, surface engineering, and regenerative medicine continue to improve the biocompatibility of products used in healthcare and research.</p>
