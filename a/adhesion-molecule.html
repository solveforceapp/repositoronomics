    <h1>Adhesion Molecule</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Adhesion molecules are proteins located on the cell surface that facilitate binding between cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. These molecules play critical roles in tissue formation, immune response, and cellular communication. Major classes include cadherins, integrins, selectins, and immunoglobulin superfamily members. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, adhesion molecules are studied for their involvement in development, disease, and the engineering of artificial tissues and neural interfaces.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Adhesion molecules are essential for processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and immune cell trafficking. In neurotechnology, they are key to synapse formation, neural circuit maintenance, and the integration of neural implants. Disruption of adhesion molecule function is implicated in cancer metastasis, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Techniques such as immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and gene editing are used to study and manipulate adhesion molecules for therapeutic and research purposes. Advances in biomaterials and tissue engineering leverage adhesion molecules to improve the biocompatibility and functionality of implants and prosthetics.</p>
