      <h1>Bug</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A bug is an error, flaw, or fault in a software program or system that causes it to produce incorrect or unexpected results, or to behave in unintended ways. Bugs can arise from coding mistakes, design oversights, miscommunication of requirements, or unforeseen interactions between software components. They may manifest as crashes, incorrect outputs, security vulnerabilities, or degraded performance. The term “bug” dates back to the early days of computing and engineering, famously attributed to a moth found in a computer relay. Bugs are an inevitable part of software development due to the complexity of modern systems and the limitations of human cognition. The process of identifying, isolating, and correcting bugs is known as debugging, which is a critical skill for developers and engineers. Effective debugging requires analytical thinking, familiarity with the codebase, and the use of specialized tools and techniques.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bug tracking and resolution are central to the software development lifecycle, ensuring that products meet quality standards and user expectations. Development teams use issue trackers, version control systems, and automated testing frameworks to identify, document, and fix bugs efficiently. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines help catch bugs early by running tests on every code change. In production environments, monitoring and logging tools detect anomalies and facilitate rapid response to critical issues. Security bugs, such as vulnerabilities or exploits, require immediate attention to protect users and data. Open-source projects often rely on community contributions to report and resolve bugs, fostering collaboration and transparency. The cost of fixing bugs increases the later they are discovered, making proactive testing and code reviews essential. As software becomes more complex and interconnected, robust bug management practices are vital for delivering reliable, secure, and user-friendly applications across all industries.</p>
