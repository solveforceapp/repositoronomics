    <h1>Aromatic Amino Acid</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Aromatic amino acids are a class of amino acids that contain an aromatic ring in their side chain. The three standard aromatic amino acids are phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. These amino acids play critical roles in protein structure, enzyme function, and cellular signaling. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, aromatic amino acids are studied for their involvement in metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and disease.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, aromatic amino acids are used in the production of pharmaceuticals, food additives, and biomaterials. In neurotechnology, they are precursors for neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, which are essential for brain function and behavior. Techniques such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, and metabolic engineering are used to study and manipulate aromatic amino acid pathways. Advances in synthetic biology, systems biology, and metabolic engineering continue to expand the applications of aromatic amino acids in science and medicine.</p>
