    <h1>Fabric</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>In networking and IT, a fabric refers to an interconnected mesh of devices, switches, or nodes that work together to provide seamless data communication. Network fabrics are designed to optimize performance, scalability, and redundancy, often using technologies like software-defined networking (SDN) or high-speed interconnects. The term is also used in storage and compute environments to describe integrated, flexible infrastructures.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Network fabrics are foundational in modern data centers, cloud environments, and enterprise networks. For example, a data center fabric enables rapid, reliable communication between servers and storage systems, supporting virtualization, big data analytics, and high-availability applications. Fabrics are also key to building scalable, resilient IT architectures that can adapt to changing business needs.</p>
