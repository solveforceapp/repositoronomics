    <h1>Accumulator</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An accumulator is a component in computational and electronic systems that temporarily stores intermediate results or data during processing. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, accumulators are used in analog and digital circuits, laboratory instruments, and data acquisition systems to collect, sum, or buffer signals for further analysis. The design and capacity of an accumulator influence the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of data processing in experimental and clinical applications.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, accumulators are found in automated analyzers, flow cytometers, and imaging systems, where they aggregate data from multiple measurements or channels. In neurotechnology, accumulators are used in neural recording devices, brain-computer interfaces, and signal processing units to store and process neural signals, enabling real-time analysis and feedback. The use of accumulators supports high-throughput screening, large-scale data integration, and the development of intelligent systems for diagnostics, monitoring, and therapy. Advances in microelectronics and software algorithms continue to enhance the performance and versatility of accumulators in life sciences and brain research.</p>
