    <h1>Afferent Neuron</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An afferent neuron, also known as a sensory neuron, is a type of nerve cell that transmits sensory information from the body's periphery to the central nervous system (CNS). These neurons detect stimuli such as touch, temperature, pain, and proprioception, converting them into electrical signals that are relayed to the brain and spinal cord for processing. Afferent neurons are essential for perception, reflexes, and the coordination of movement and behavior.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, afferent neurons are studied to understand sensory processing, develop prosthetic devices, and design brain-computer interfaces. Techniques such as electrophysiology, optogenetics, and neural imaging are used to investigate afferent neuron function and connectivity. Advances in regenerative medicine and neural engineering aim to restore or enhance sensory function in individuals with nerve injuries, sensory deficits, or neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding afferent neuron biology informs the development of therapies and technologies that improve quality of life and expand human capabilities.</p>
