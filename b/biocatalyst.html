      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A biocatalyst is a natural or engineered enzyme or microorganism that accelerates chemical reactions in biological systems. Biocatalysts are highly specific, efficient, and environmentally friendly, making them valuable tools in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and green chemistry. They are used to synthesize, modify, or degrade a wide range of molecules under mild conditions.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, biocatalysts are used for the production of drugs, fine chemicals, biofuels, and food ingredients. In neurotechnology, biocatalysts are explored for their roles in neurotransmitter synthesis, brain metabolism, and the development of biosensors. Advances in protein engineering, directed evolution, and systems biology continue to expand the applications of biocatalysts in science, industry, and medicine.</p>
