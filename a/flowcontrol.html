    <h1>Flow Control</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Flow control is a technique used in data communications to manage the rate of data transmission between two devices, ensuring that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver. It helps prevent data loss, congestion, and buffer overflow in networks and communication protocols.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Flow control is implemented in protocols like TCP and in hardware such as network switches. For example, TCP uses windowing mechanisms to adjust the flow of data based on network conditions, optimizing performance and reliability.</p>
