    <h1>8M Urea</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>8M urea is a highly concentrated solution of urea, an organic compound commonly used as a protein denaturant in molecular biology and biotechnology. At this concentration, urea disrupts hydrogen bonds and secondary structures in proteins, rendering them unfolded and soluble. 8M urea is essential for protein extraction, purification, and analysis, particularly in techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and mass spectrometry. In neurotechnology, 8M urea is used to clear brain tissue, making it transparent for deep imaging and connectomics studies. The solution must be handled with care, as prolonged exposure can degrade sensitive biomolecules.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, 8M urea is widely used to solubilize and refold recombinant proteins, facilitate protein-protein interaction studies, and prepare samples for electrophoresis. In neurotechnology, it is a key reagent in tissue clearing protocols, enabling high-resolution imaging of neural circuits and brain architecture. The ability to render brain tissue transparent has revolutionized connectomics, allowing researchers to map neural networks in three dimensions. 8M urea is also used in the study of protein aggregation, misfolding, and neurodegenerative diseases, providing insights into the molecular basis of brain disorders. Its versatility and effectiveness make it a staple in advanced bioscience laboratories.</p>
