    <h1>Failover</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Failover is a backup operational mode in which the functions of a system component (such as a server, network, or database) are automatically assumed by a secondary system when the primary system fails or is taken offline. This process ensures high availability and business continuity by minimizing downtime and service disruption.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Failover is critical in data centers, cloud services, and telecommunications networks. For example, in a VoIP system, if the primary call server fails, a backup server immediately takes over to maintain uninterrupted communication. Failover mechanisms are implemented using redundant hardware, clustering, and automated monitoring tools.</p>
