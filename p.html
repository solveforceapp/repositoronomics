      <h2>Packet Switching</h2>
      <p>Packet switching is a method of data transmission where information is broken into packets and sent independently over a network. It is the foundation of the internet and modern telecommunications, enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable communication.</p>
      <h2>Parallel Processing</h2>
      <p>Parallel processing is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes to increase computational speed and efficiency. It is used in supercomputers, data centers, and multi-core processors for high-performance computing.</p>
      <h2>Patch Panel</h2>
      <p>A patch panel is a hardware device that organizes and connects network cables in a structured cabling system. Patch panels simplify network management, troubleshooting, and reconfiguration in data centers and offices.</p>
      <h2>Phishing</h2>
      <p>Phishing is a cyberattack technique that uses deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details. Security awareness and email filtering help defend against phishing attacks.</p>
      <h2>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>
      <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without dealing with infrastructure. PaaS accelerates development and deployment for businesses and developers.</p>
      <h2>PoE (Power over Ethernet)</h2>
      <p>Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology that delivers electrical power and data over standard Ethernet cables. PoE simplifies installation of devices like IP cameras, phones, and wireless access points by eliminating the need for separate power supplies.</p>
      <h2>Port Forwarding</h2>
      <p>Port forwarding is a network configuration that directs incoming traffic from a specific port to a designated device or service on a local network. It is used for remote access, gaming, and hosting servers behind firewalls or NAT devices.</p>
      <h2>Protocol</h2>
      <p>A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern communication between devices on a network. Common protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, each serving specific purposes in data exchange.</p>
      <h2>Proxy Server</h2>
      <p>A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and other servers, forwarding requests and responses. Proxies are used for security, content filtering, privacy, and performance optimization in networks.</p>
      <h2>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h2>
      <p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework for managing digital certificates and encryption keys. PKI enables secure communication, authentication, and digital signatures in online transactions and secure email.</p>
