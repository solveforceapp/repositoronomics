    <h1>Acetylcholine</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger that transmits signals across synapses in the nervous system. It is synthesized from choline and acetyl-CoA and is involved in muscle activation, attention, learning, and memory. Acetylcholine acts on two main types of receptors: nicotinic and muscarinic, each mediating different physiological effects. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, acetylcholine is studied for its role in neural signaling, cognitive function, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and myasthenia gravis.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, acetylcholine is used in assays to study receptor function, drug screening, and the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. In neurotechnology, it is a target for brain-computer interfaces, neuromodulation devices, and cognitive enhancement strategies. Research on acetylcholine signaling informs the design of neural implants, prosthetics, and rehabilitation protocols for patients with motor or cognitive impairments. Advances in molecular biology, pharmacology, and neuroimaging continue to reveal new insights into the functions and applications of acetylcholine in health and disease.</p>
