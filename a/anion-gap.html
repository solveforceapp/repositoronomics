    <h1>Anion Gap</h1>

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Anion gap is a calculated value representing the difference between measured cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged ions) in blood plasma. It is used clinically to assess acid-base balance and diagnose metabolic acidosis. The anion gap provides insight into the presence of unmeasured ions and helps identify underlying causes of metabolic disturbances.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, monitoring the anion gap is important for understanding metabolic processes, disease states, and the effects of drugs or interventions. The anion gap is used in critical care, nephrology, and toxicology to guide diagnosis and treatment. Advances in analytical chemistry and point-of-care testing are improving the accuracy and accessibility of anion gap measurements for clinical and research applications. Understanding the anion gap also informs the development of biosensors and diagnostic devices for metabolic monitoring.</p>
