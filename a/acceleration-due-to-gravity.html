    <h1>Acceleration Due to Gravity</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Acceleration due to gravity is the constant rate at which objects accelerate toward the center of the Earth (or another celestial body) under the influence of gravity, typically denoted as "g" and valued at approximately 9.81 m/s² on Earth. This fundamental physical constant is essential for calibrating instruments, designing experiments, and interpreting data in biotechnology and neurotechnology. Accurate knowledge of gravitational acceleration is crucial for ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of measurements involving mass, force, or motion.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, acceleration due to gravity is considered in the operation of centrifuges, sedimentation assays, and bioreactors, where gravitational forces influence the separation and behavior of biological materials. In neurotechnology, it is relevant for the calibration of motion sensors, the study of vestibular function, and the development of balance and mobility aids. Understanding gravitational acceleration also supports research in space biology, where altered gravity conditions affect cellular and physiological processes. Advances in instrumentation and computational modeling continue to refine the measurement and application of gravitational acceleration in life sciences and brain research.</p>
