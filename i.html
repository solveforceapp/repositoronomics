      <h1>I Terms</h1>
      <h2>IC (Integrated Circuit)</h2>
      <p>An Integrated Circuit (IC) is a set of electronic circuits on a small chip of semiconductor material, typically silicon. ICs are the building blocks of modern electronics, enabling complex functions in computers, smartphones, and countless digital devices.</p>
      <h2>IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</h2>
      <p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required for software development. IDEs provide code editors, debuggers, and build automation, streamlining the programming process for developers.</p>
      <h2>IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)</h2>
      <p>The IEEE is a professional association dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. It develops standards for electronics, telecommunications, and computing, including Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) and Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).</p>
      <h2>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</h2>
      <p>IMAP is a standard email protocol that allows users to access and manage their email on a remote server. IMAP enables synchronization across multiple devices, making it ideal for modern email clients.</p>
      <h2>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
      <p>IaaS is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Organizations use IaaS to scale infrastructure on demand, reducing costs and increasing flexibility.</p>
      <h2>Information Security (InfoSec)</h2>
      <p>Information Security (InfoSec) encompasses policies, procedures, and technologies designed to protect digital information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. InfoSec is critical for maintaining privacy and compliance.</p>
      <h2>Input Device</h2>
      <p>An input device is any hardware component used to enter data into a computer system, such as keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones. Input devices are essential for user interaction and data acquisition.</p>
      <h2>Instance</h2>
      <p>An instance is a specific realization of an object, process, or service. In cloud computing, an instance refers to a virtual server or resource provisioned for use.</p>
      <h2>Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices that collect and exchange data. IoT enables smart homes, industrial automation, and real-time monitoring across various sectors.</p>
      <h2>IP Address</h2>
      <p>An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to devices on a network, enabling communication and data exchange. IP addresses can be IPv4 or IPv6, supporting the global expansion of the internet.</p>
