    <h1>Absorption Spectrum</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An absorption spectrum is a graphical representation of the wavelengths of light or electromagnetic radiation absorbed by a substance, molecule, or material. Each substance has a unique absorption spectrum, determined by its molecular structure and electronic transitions. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, absorption spectra are used to identify, quantify, and characterize biomolecules, cells, and tissues, providing insights into their composition, function, and interactions.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, absorption spectra are essential for spectrophotometric assays, DNA/RNA quantification, and the analysis of proteins, pigments, or metabolites. In neurotechnology, absorption spectra inform the design of optical imaging systems, phototherapy devices, and neural probes. The ability to measure and interpret absorption spectra enables researchers to monitor biological processes, diagnose diseases, and develop targeted therapies. Advances in spectroscopy, nanotechnology, and computational analysis continue to expand the applications of absorption spectra in life sciences and brain research.</p>
