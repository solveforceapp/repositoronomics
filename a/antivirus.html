      <p>Antivirus software is a program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) such as viruses, worms, and trojans from computers and networks. It uses signature-based detection, heuristics, and real-time monitoring to protect systems.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Antivirus solutions are essential for individuals and organizations to safeguard data, maintain system integrity, and prevent cyberattacks. They are deployed on endpoints, servers, and gateways, often as part of a broader cybersecurity strategy.</p>
