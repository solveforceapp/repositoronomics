      <h1>Bandwidth</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Bandwidth is a fundamental concept in networking and telecommunications that refers to the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a communication channel or network connection. It is typically measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits (Kbps), megabits (Mbps), or gigabits (Gbps) per second. Bandwidth determines how much information can be sent or received in a given period, directly impacting the speed and capacity of digital communications. The term can apply to wired and wireless networks, including fiber optics, copper cables, Wi-Fi, and cellular connections. Bandwidth is often confused with throughput, which measures actual data transfer rates, but bandwidth represents the theoretical maximum. Factors such as network congestion, signal quality, and hardware limitations can affect usable bandwidth. In modern IT environments, bandwidth is a critical resource that must be managed and optimized to support business applications, cloud services, and multimedia content.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bandwidth plays a pivotal role in the performance and reliability of internet, voice, and video services for both businesses and consumers. For example, streaming high-definition video or conducting video conferences requires substantial bandwidth to ensure smooth playback and minimal latency. Enterprises rely on sufficient bandwidth to support cloud computing, remote work, and real-time collaboration tools. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) design their networks to balance bandwidth allocation among users, employing technologies such as Quality of Service (QoS) and traffic shaping to prioritize critical applications. In telecom, bandwidth management is essential for optimizing network resources, reducing congestion, and delivering consistent service quality. Organizations may invest in dedicated internet access or private circuits to guarantee bandwidth for mission-critical operations. As digital transformation accelerates, the demand for higher bandwidth continues to grow, driving innovation in network infrastructure and wireless technologies to meet evolving connectivity needs.</p>
