    <h1>Abbe Number</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>The Abbe number is a measure of the dispersion of light in optical materials, defined as the ratio of the refractive index difference to the change in wavelength. It quantifies how much a material spreads different wavelengths of light, which is critical in the design of lenses and optical systems. In neurotechnology, the Abbe number is important for selecting materials for neural imaging devices, microscopes, and optical fibers, ensuring minimal chromatic aberration and high image quality.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, the Abbe number guides the selection of glass, polymers, and other materials for constructing high-precision optical instruments. It is essential for the development of advanced microscopes, endoscopes, and neural imaging systems that require accurate color reproduction and minimal distortion. Understanding and optimizing the Abbe number enables researchers and engineers to achieve clearer images, better resolution, and more reliable data in both laboratory and clinical settings.</p>
