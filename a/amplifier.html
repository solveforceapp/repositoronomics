    <h1>Amplifier</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An amplifier is a device or system that increases the strength of a signal, such as electrical, optical, or biochemical signals. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, amplifiers are used to enhance weak biological signals for detection, analysis, or further processing. Amplifiers can be electronic circuits, molecular systems, or engineered proteins, depending on the application and the type of signal being amplified.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, amplifiers are essential for recording neural activity, enabling the detection of action potentials, local field potentials, and other bioelectrical signals from the brain and nervous system. High-gain, low-noise amplifiers are used in brain-computer interfaces, neural prosthetics, and electrophysiological research. In biotechnology, amplifiers are used in biosensors, diagnostic devices, and molecular assays to increase sensitivity and accuracy. Advances in nanotechnology, materials science, and synthetic biology are driving the development of novel amplifiers with improved performance and new functionalities for research, clinical, and industrial applications.</p>
