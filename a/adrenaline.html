    <h1>Adrenaline</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone and neurotransmitter produced by the adrenal glands and certain neurons. It plays a central role in the body's fight-or-flight response, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy availability. Adrenaline acts on adrenergic receptors throughout the body, influencing cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic functions. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, adrenaline is studied for its effects on stress, cognition, and the development of therapeutics targeting adrenergic signaling.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Adrenaline is used clinically to treat anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and asthma. In research, it serves as a model for studying stress responses, neural signaling, and the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. Advances in drug development target adrenergic pathways to treat hypertension, anxiety, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In neurotechnology, understanding adrenaline's effects informs the design of devices and therapies that modulate autonomic function and stress resilience.</p>
