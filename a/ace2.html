    <h1>ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2)</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>ACE2, or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a critical role in the renin-angiotensin system, regulating blood pressure, fluid balance, and cardiovascular function. ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain, where it converts angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor, into angiotensin-(1-7), a vasodilator. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, ACE2 has gained prominence as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, making it a key target for research on viral entry, infection mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, ACE2 is studied for its role in cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and organ protection, as well as its involvement in viral infections. In neurotechnology, ACE2 expression in the brain is investigated for its impact on neurovascular health, blood-brain barrier integrity, and neurological complications of COVID-19. The development of ACE2-based assays, inhibitors, and therapeutic agents supports drug discovery, vaccine development, and personalized medicine. Advances in molecular biology, structural analysis, and bioinformatics continue to expand our understanding of ACE2 and its significance in health and disease.</p>
