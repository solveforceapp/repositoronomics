      <h1>Abstraction</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering that involves reducing complexity by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features of an object or system. It allows developers to focus on high-level operations while ignoring low-level implementation details, making systems easier to design, understand, and maintain.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Abstraction is widely used in object-oriented programming, where classes define abstract data types and interfaces. For example, a 'Vehicle' class may provide an abstract interface for 'drive' and 'stop' methods, while specific vehicle types (car, truck, bike) implement the details. Abstraction also underpins API design, database modeling, and user interface development, enabling modularity and code reuse across large software projects.</p>
