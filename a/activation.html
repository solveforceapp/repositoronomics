    <h1>Activation</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Activation refers to the process by which a molecule, cell, or system is triggered to perform a specific function, often in response to a stimulus such as a chemical signal, electrical impulse, or environmental change. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, activation commonly involves the opening of ion channels, the initiation of signaling pathways, or the expression of genes. Activation is a fundamental concept in understanding how biological systems respond to internal and external cues.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, activation is studied in the context of enzyme function, receptor signaling, and gene expression. Techniques such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, and electrical stimulation are used to activate specific cells or pathways in research and therapeutic applications. In neurotechnology, activation of neural circuits underlies brain function, behavior, and the effects of neurostimulation devices. Understanding activation mechanisms supports the development of targeted therapies, brain-computer interfaces, and diagnostic tools for neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>
