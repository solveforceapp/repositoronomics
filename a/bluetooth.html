      <h1>Bluetooth</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Bluetooth is a widely adopted wireless technology standard that enables the exchange of data over short distances using ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio waves in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Developed in the 1990s and named after a Viking king, Bluetooth was designed to replace cables for connecting devices such as phones, computers, and peripherals. It supports the creation of personal area networks (PANs), allowing multiple devices to communicate seamlessly within a typical range of 10 to 100 meters, depending on the device class. Bluetooth technology has evolved through several versions, each improving data rates, security, and energy efficiency. Key features include device discovery, pairing, encryption, and support for multiple simultaneous connections. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), introduced in Bluetooth 4.0, is optimized for minimal power consumption, making it ideal for battery-powered IoT devices and wearables. The technology’s interoperability and ease of use have made it a staple in consumer electronics, healthcare, automotive, and industrial applications.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bluetooth is integral to modern digital life, powering a vast ecosystem of wireless devices and services. In consumer electronics, Bluetooth enables wireless audio streaming to headphones, speakers, and car infotainment systems, eliminating the need for physical cables. Smartphones and computers use Bluetooth for file transfer, peripheral connectivity (keyboards, mice, printers), and tethering. In the Internet of Things (IoT), Bluetooth connects smart home devices, fitness trackers, medical sensors, and industrial equipment, supporting automation and remote monitoring. Automotive manufacturers use Bluetooth for hands-free calling, audio streaming, and vehicle diagnostics. Bluetooth Mesh, a recent advancement, allows large-scale device networks for smart buildings and industrial automation. Security features such as pairing, authentication, and encryption protect against eavesdropping and unauthorized access, though users must remain vigilant against vulnerabilities. As wireless technology continues to advance, Bluetooth remains a cornerstone of connectivity, enabling seamless, low-power communication across an ever-expanding range of devices and applications.</p>
