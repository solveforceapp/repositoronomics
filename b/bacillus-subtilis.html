<h1>Bacillus subtilis</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in soil and the gastrointestinal tract of animals. It is known for its ability to form endospores, which allow it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. B. subtilis is a model organism in molecular biology and biotechnology due to its genetic tractability, rapid growth, and capacity for protein secretion.</p>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <p>In biotechnology, Bacillus subtilis is used for the production of enzymes, antibiotics, and specialty chemicals. Its ability to secrete proteins makes it valuable for industrial-scale fermentation and recombinant protein production. In neurotechnology, B. subtilis is studied for its interactions with the gut-brain axis and its potential role in modulating neural function through the microbiome. Advances in genetic engineering, systems biology, and synthetic biology continue to expand the applications of B. subtilis in research, industry, and medicine.</p>
