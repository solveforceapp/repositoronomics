<h1>Bacteriophage</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>A bacteriophage, or phage, is a virus that infects and replicates within bacteria. Phages are highly specific to their bacterial hosts and play a significant role in regulating bacterial populations in natural environments. They have diverse structures and life cycles, including lytic and lysogenic pathways, and are abundant in soil, water, and the human microbiome.</p>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <p>In biotechnology, bacteriophages are used as tools for genetic engineering, bacterial detection, and the development of phage therapy to treat antibiotic-resistant infections. In neurotechnology, phages are explored for their potential to modulate the gut-brain axis and influence neurological health through microbiome interactions. Advances in synthetic biology, genomics, and nanotechnology continue to expand the applications of bacteriophages in medicine, agriculture, and environmental management.</p>
