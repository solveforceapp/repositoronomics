    <h1>Firewall Testing</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Firewall testing is the process of evaluating a firewall’s effectiveness in enforcing security policies and protecting against threats. This involves simulating attacks, scanning for vulnerabilities, and verifying that rules are correctly implemented and enforced.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Firewall testing is performed by security professionals during audits, compliance checks, and incident response. For example, a penetration tester may attempt to bypass firewall rules to identify weaknesses, helping organizations strengthen their defenses.</p>
