      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Azotobacter is a genus of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria found in soil and water. These bacteria play a vital role in the nitrogen cycle by converting atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants. Azotobacter is known for its high metabolic activity, production of growth-promoting substances, and ability to form resistant cysts. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, Azotobacter is studied for its applications in agriculture, environmental management, and microbial ecology.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, Azotobacter is used to produce biofertilizers, enhance soil fertility, and promote sustainable agriculture. Research into Azotobacter physiology and genetics informs the development of microbial inoculants and bioremediation strategies. In neurotechnology, Azotobacter serves as a model for studying microbial metabolism, stress responses, and the impact of soil microbiomes on plant and animal health. Advances in genomics, metabolic engineering, and environmental biotechnology continue to expand the applications of Azotobacter in science and industry.</p>
