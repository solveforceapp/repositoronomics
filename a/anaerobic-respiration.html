    <h1>Anaerobic Respiration</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Anaerobic respiration is a metabolic process in which cells generate energy without the use of oxygen. Instead, alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, sulfate, or carbon dioxide are used. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, producing fewer ATP molecules per glucose molecule. It is common in certain bacteria, archaea, and in animal tissues under low-oxygen conditions, such as during intense exercise.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, anaerobic respiration is harnessed in processes such as fermentation, wastewater treatment, and the production of biogas. Understanding this process is crucial for optimizing industrial bioprocesses, developing bioenergy solutions, and studying microbial ecology. In neurotechnology, anaerobic metabolism is relevant to brain function under hypoxic conditions, such as stroke or traumatic injury. Advances in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and environmental biotechnology continue to expand the applications of anaerobic respiration in research, industry, and medicine.</p>
