      <h1>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address) within a local area network. ARP operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model and is essential for enabling communication between devices on the same subnet.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>ARP is used by routers and switches to determine the hardware address of a device when only its IP address is known. It is fundamental for packet delivery in Ethernet networks and is also used in troubleshooting network connectivity issues.</p>
