      <h2>Absolute Path</h2>
      <p>An absolute path is the complete address or location of a file or directory within a file system, starting from the root directory. It specifies every directory and subdirectory traversed to reach the file, ensuring there is no ambiguity regardless of the current working directory. For example, in Unix-like systems, <code>/home/user/documents/file.txt</code> is an absolute path, while in Windows, <code>C:\Users\Name\Documents\file.txt</code> is an absolute path. Absolute paths are essential for scripting, automation, and system administration, as they provide a reliable way to reference files and directories across different environments.</p>
      <h2>Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)</h2>
      <p>The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is a high-speed point-to-point channel designed for attaching a video card to a computer’s motherboard, primarily to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics. Introduced by Intel in 1997, AGP provided a direct connection between the graphics card and the system memory, allowing for faster rendering of complex images and textures compared to the older PCI standard. AGP slots were common on motherboards throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, but have since been replaced by PCI Express (PCIe) in modern systems.</p>
      <h2>Accelerator</h2>
      <p>An accelerator is a specialized hardware device, such as a microprocessor, ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), or expansion card, designed to offload specific computational tasks from the main CPU. Examples include graphics accelerators (GPUs), AI accelerators for machine learning, and cryptographic accelerators for secure data processing. By handling dedicated workloads, accelerators improve overall system performance and efficiency, especially in high-demand applications like gaming, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <h2>Accumulator</h2>
      <p>The accumulator is a register within a computer’s arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that temporarily stores intermediate results of arithmetic and logic operations. It is a fundamental component in early computer architectures and is still conceptually present in modern CPUs. The accumulator allows for efficient chaining of operations, as the result of one calculation can be immediately used as input for the next, reducing the need for repeated memory access.</p>
      <h2>Adaptive Maintenance</h2>
      <p>Adaptive maintenance refers to modifications made to software after its initial deployment to ensure it continues to function correctly as its environment changes. This may include updates for compatibility with new operating systems, hardware, or third-party software. Adaptive maintenance is a key aspect of the software lifecycle, ensuring longevity and usability as technology evolves.</p>
      <h2>Address Space</h2>
      <p>Address space is the range of memory addresses that a process or device can use to access data. In computing, address space can refer to physical memory (RAM), virtual memory, or memory-mapped devices. Each process typically has its own address space, providing isolation and security. The size of the address space is determined by the architecture (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit), affecting how much memory can be directly accessed.</p>
      <h2>Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX)</h2>
      <p>Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX) is a motherboard and power supply configuration specification developed by Intel in 1995.

The ALU processes data and instructions, enabling computers to perform calculations and make decisions.</p>
      <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
      <p>Arithmetic operators are symbols used in programming languages to perform mathematical operations on numeric data types. Common operators include <code>+</code> (addition), <code>-</code> (subtraction), <code>*</code> (multiplication), and <code>/</code> (division). These operators are fundamental to data processing and algorithm development.</p>
      <h2>Array Data Structure (Array)</h2>
      <p>An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access and manipulation. They are widely used in programming for tasks such as sorting, searching, and data storage.</p>
      <h2>Artifact</h2>
      <p>In software development, an artifact is any tangible by-product produced during the development process. Artifacts include use cases, class diagrams, UML models, requirements documents, design specifications, project plans, and risk assessments. They serve as documentation and reference points throughout the software lifecycle.</p>
      <h2>Assembly Language</h2>
      <p>Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses mnemonic codes to represent machine instructions specific to a computer’s architecture. Assembly provides direct control over hardware, enabling optimization and efficient resource management, but requires detailed knowledge of the underlying system.</p>
      <h2>Assignment Operator</h2>
      <p>The assignment operator (<code>=</code>) is used in programming languages to assign a value to a variable. For example, <code>x = 5</code> assigns the value 5 to the variable <code>x</code>. Assignment operators are fundamental to variable management and program logic.</p>
      <h2>Associative Array</h2>
      <p>An associative array, also known as a map or dictionary, is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a specific value, allowing for efficient data retrieval, addition, and modification. Associative arrays are widely used in programming for tasks such as configuration management and data indexing.</p>
      <h2>Attribute</h2>
      <p>An attribute is a property or characteristic associated with an object, class, or element in programming and data modeling. Attributes define the state or behavior of an object and are used to store data or metadata. For example, a <code>Person</code> class may have attributes such as <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>address</code>.</p>
      <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
      <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information, such as images, sounds, or data, onto the real world through devices like smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses. AR enhances user experiences in gaming, education, navigation, and industrial applications by blending virtual and physical environments.</p>
