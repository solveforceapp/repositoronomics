    <h1>Adsorption</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Adsorption is the process by which atoms, ions, or molecules adhere to the surface of a solid or liquid, forming a thin film. This phenomenon is distinct from absorption, where substances penetrate into the bulk of the material. Adsorption plays a vital role in biotechnology and neurotechnology, particularly in the purification of biomolecules, sensor development, and the design of drug delivery systems.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, adsorption is used in chromatography, filtration, and the immobilization of enzymes or antibodies on surfaces. In neurotechnology, adsorption is critical for the fabrication of biosensors, neural electrodes, and implantable devices that interact with biological tissues. Understanding adsorption mechanisms informs the development of materials with tailored surface properties for improved biocompatibility, sensitivity, and selectivity. Advances in nanotechnology and surface chemistry continue to expand the applications of adsorption in diagnostics, therapeutics, and research tools.</p>
