    <h1>Firewall Policy</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A firewall policy is a set of rules and guidelines that dictate how a firewall manages network traffic. These policies define which types of traffic are allowed or blocked, based on criteria such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and application types.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Firewall policies are essential for enforcing security in corporate networks, data centers, and cloud environments. For example, a company may implement a firewall policy that blocks all inbound traffic except for web and email services, reducing the attack surface and protecting sensitive data.</p>
