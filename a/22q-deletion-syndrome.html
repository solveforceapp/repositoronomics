    <h1>22q Deletion Syndrome</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>22q Deletion Syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion of a small segment of chromosome 22. This deletion affects multiple genes and leads to a wide range of developmental, cognitive, and health issues. Common features include heart defects, immune system deficiencies, cleft palate, learning disabilities, and distinctive facial features. The syndrome is one of the most common microdeletion syndromes, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 4,000 live births. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through genetic testing, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or microarray analysis. The variability in symptoms makes clinical management complex, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology, immunology, speech therapy, and educational support.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, 22q Deletion Syndrome is studied to understand the genetic basis of developmental disorders and the interplay between genetics and neurodevelopment. Research on this syndrome has provided insights into the roles of specific genes in brain development, immune function, and congenital heart disease. Animal models and patient-derived stem cells are used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the syndrome and to develop targeted therapies. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve outcomes, highlighting the importance of genetic screening in at-risk populations. Advances in gene editing and regenerative medicine hold promise for future treatments, while ongoing research continues to unravel the complex genotype-phenotype relationships associated with 22q Deletion Syndrome.</p>
