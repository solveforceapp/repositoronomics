    <h1>Firewall Service</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A firewall service is a managed security solution that provides firewall protection as a service, either on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid model. These services include rule management, monitoring, threat detection, and reporting, often delivered by specialized security providers.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Firewall services are used by organizations that lack in-house expertise or resources to manage complex security infrastructures. For example, a small business may subscribe to a cloud-based firewall service to protect its network from cyber threats without maintaining dedicated hardware or staff.</p>
