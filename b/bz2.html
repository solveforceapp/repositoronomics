      <h1>BZ2</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>BZ2 is a file compression format and algorithm known for its high compression ratio. It uses the Burrows-Wheeler transform and Huffman coding to efficiently reduce file sizes, commonly used for archiving and data transfer.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>BZ2 is widely used in software distribution, backups, and data storage to minimize disk space and bandwidth usage. Its support in many programming languages and tools makes it a popular choice for compressing large files and datasets.</p>
