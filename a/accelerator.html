      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An accelerator is a device or system that increases the energy of particles, such as electrons, protons, or ions, to high velocities using electromagnetic fields. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, accelerators are used for a variety of purposes, including radiation therapy, imaging, and the study of molecular and cellular processes. Particle accelerators range from small benchtop devices to large-scale facilities, such as synchrotrons and cyclotrons, each designed for specific applications in research, medicine, and industry.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, accelerators are used to generate X-rays, gamma rays, or particle beams for imaging, sterilization, and the modification of biological materials. In neurotechnology, accelerators enable advanced brain imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy, providing high-resolution views of neural structures and functions. Accelerators also play a role in the production of radioisotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic use, supporting personalized medicine and targeted treatments. Ongoing advances in accelerator technology are expanding their accessibility and versatility, driving innovation in life sciences and brain research.</p>
