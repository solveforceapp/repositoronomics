    <h1>Firewall Rules</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Firewall rules are specific instructions that determine how a firewall handles incoming and outgoing network traffic. These rules define which traffic is allowed or denied based on parameters such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and application types, forming the core of a firewall’s security policy.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Firewall rules are used by network administrators to enforce security policies and protect against unauthorized access. For example, a rule may allow only HTTPS traffic to a web server while blocking all other ports, reducing the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
