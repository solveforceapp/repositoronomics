      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Beta-lactam refers to a class of antibiotics that contain a beta-lactam ring in their molecular structure. This group includes penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams. Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to cell lysis and death. They are among the most widely used and effective antibiotics in clinical medicine.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, beta-lactam antibiotics are used in the selection of genetically engineered bacteria, the treatment of bacterial infections, and the study of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. In neurotechnology, beta-lactams are investigated for their potential neuroprotective effects and their impact on the gut-brain axis. Advances in medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and microbiology continue to expand the applications of beta-lactams in medicine, research, and industry.</p>
