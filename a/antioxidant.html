      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules, thereby protecting cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals. Antioxidants can be enzymatic or non-enzymatic and are found in various foods, supplements, and produced endogenously in the body. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, antioxidants are studied for their roles in health, disease prevention, and therapeutic development.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, antioxidants are used to preserve biological samples, enhance the stability of pharmaceuticals, and develop functional foods. In neurotechnology, antioxidants are investigated for their potential to prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, by reducing oxidative stress in the brain. Techniques such as high-throughput screening, molecular modeling, and clinical trials are used to identify and evaluate new antioxidants. Advances in this field continue to expand the applications of antioxidants in medicine, nutrition, and research.</p>
