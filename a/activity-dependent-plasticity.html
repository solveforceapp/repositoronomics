    <h1>Activity-Dependent Plasticity</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Activity-dependent plasticity refers to the ability of neural circuits to change their structure and function in response to patterns of activity. This phenomenon underlies learning, memory, and adaptation in the nervous system. Synaptic strength, dendritic architecture, and gene expression can all be modified by neural activity, leading to long-lasting changes in connectivity and function. Activity-dependent plasticity is a fundamental principle in neurobiology, with implications for development, rehabilitation, and the treatment of neurological disorders.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, activity-dependent plasticity is harnessed to develop therapies for brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. Techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), electrical stimulation, and behavioral training are used to promote beneficial plasticity and recovery of function. Research into the molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent plasticity informs the design of drugs and devices that can enhance or restore neural plasticity. Understanding this process is also critical for the development of brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics that adapt to user needs over time.</p>
