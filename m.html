      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It powers applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, transforming industries from healthcare to finance.</p>
      <h2>MAC Address</h2>
      <p>A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. MAC addresses are essential for network management, security, and device identification.</p>
      <h2>Malware</h2>
      <p>Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Types of malware include viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, and trojans. Cybersecurity measures are critical for detecting and preventing malware attacks.</p>
      <h2>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</h2>
      <p>A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) connects users and resources in a geographic area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city or campus. MANs are used by businesses, governments, and service providers for high-speed connectivity.</p>
      <h2>Mesh Network</h2>
      <p>A mesh network is a network topology where each node relays data for the network, providing redundancy and reliability. Mesh networks are used in wireless networking, IoT, and disaster recovery scenarios.</p>
      <h2>Microprocessor</h2>
      <p>A microprocessor is an integrated circuit that contains the functions of a central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Microprocessors are the brains of computers, smartphones, and embedded systems, driving computation and control.</p>
      <h2>Modem</h2>
      <p>A modem is a device that modulates and demodulates analog signals for digital data transmission over telephone lines, cable systems, or wireless networks. Modems enable internet connectivity and remote communication.</p>
      <h2>Motherboard</h2>
      <p>The motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer, housing the CPU, memory, and essential components. It provides connectivity and communication between all hardware parts, forming the backbone of computer systems.</p>
      <h2>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
      <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access a system. MFA enhances security by combining something you know (password), something you have (token), and something you are (biometrics).</p>
      <h2>Multiplexing</h2>
      <p>Multiplexing is a technique that combines multiple signals or data streams into one for transmission over a shared medium. It increases efficiency and bandwidth utilization in telecommunications, networking, and broadcasting.</p>
