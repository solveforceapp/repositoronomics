    <h1>Absorptivity</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Absorptivity is a physical property that quantifies the fraction of incident radiation or energy absorbed by a material or surface. It is a dimensionless value ranging from 0 (no absorption) to 1 (total absorption) and varies with wavelength, material composition, and surface characteristics. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, absorptivity is a key parameter in the design of optical, thermal, and radiation-based devices, influencing the efficiency and sensitivity of analytical instruments, sensors, and imaging systems.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, absorptivity is used to calibrate spectrophotometers, optimize photothermal therapies, and design materials for controlled drug delivery. In neurotechnology, it informs the development of neural imaging probes, optogenetic tools, and protective coatings for implants. Accurate measurement and control of absorptivity enable researchers to tailor materials and devices for specific applications, improving performance and safety. Advances in material science and nanotechnology continue to expand the range of absorptivity values achievable, supporting innovation in life sciences and brain research.</p>
