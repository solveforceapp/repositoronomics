      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An allele is a variant form of a gene found at a specific locus on a chromosome. Alleles contribute to genetic diversity and determine traits such as eye color, blood type, and susceptibility to diseases. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, alleles are studied to understand inheritance, gene function, and the genetic basis of health and disease.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Alleles are central to genetic engineering, gene therapy, and personalized medicine. Techniques such as PCR, DNA sequencing, and genome editing are used to identify, modify, and study alleles for research and clinical applications. In neurotechnology, allelic variation is investigated for its impact on brain development, function, and the risk of neurological disorders. Advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular diagnostics continue to expand our understanding of alleles and their applications in biotechnology and medicine.</p>
