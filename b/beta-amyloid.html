      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Beta-amyloid is a peptide derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is a major component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Beta-amyloid aggregates into insoluble fibrils that disrupt neural function, trigger inflammation, and contribute to neurodegeneration. The accumulation of beta-amyloid is a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology and is a target for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, beta-amyloid is studied for its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and as a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. In biotechnology, research focuses on developing drugs, antibodies, and vaccines that target beta-amyloid production, aggregation, or clearance. Advances in imaging, molecular biology, and clinical trials continue to expand our understanding and treatment of beta-amyloid-related diseases.</p>
