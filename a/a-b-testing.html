      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A/B testing is an experimental method used to compare two versions of a process, product, or interface to determine which performs better. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, A/B testing is applied to optimize laboratory protocols, device interfaces, or therapeutic interventions by systematically varying one element at a time and measuring the outcome. The approach relies on random assignment and statistical analysis to ensure that observed differences are due to the tested variable rather than chance. A/B testing is a cornerstone of evidence-based optimization, enabling researchers and engineers to make data-driven decisions and improve the effectiveness of their innovations.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, A/B testing is used to refine experimental protocols, optimize reagent concentrations, or compare the efficacy of different genetic constructs. In neurotechnology, it helps evaluate user interfaces for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), test the impact of stimulation parameters, or assess the usability of neuroprosthetic devices. The method is also employed in clinical research to compare treatment outcomes, patient engagement strategies, or rehabilitation techniques. By providing a rigorous framework for iterative improvement, A/B testing accelerates innovation and ensures that new technologies deliver measurable benefits in real-world settings.</p>
