      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Agglutination is the clumping together of particles, such as cells or microorganisms, in response to a specific antibody or other binding agent. This process is a key mechanism in the immune response, facilitating the removal of pathogens and foreign substances from the body. Agglutination is also used as a diagnostic tool in blood typing, infection detection, and the identification of biomolecules.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, agglutination assays are widely used for rapid, sensitive detection of antigens, antibodies, and other biomolecules. In neurotechnology, agglutination principles are applied to the development of biosensors, diagnostic devices, and targeted drug delivery systems. Understanding agglutination mechanisms informs the design of immunotherapies, vaccines, and research tools for studying immune and neural interactions. Advances in nanotechnology and materials science continue to expand the applications of agglutination in diagnostics, therapeutics, and research.</p>
