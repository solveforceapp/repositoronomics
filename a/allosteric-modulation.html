    <h1>Allosteric Modulation</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Allosteric modulation refers to the regulation of a protein's function through the binding of a molecule at a site other than the protein's active site, known as the allosteric site. This binding induces a conformational change that alters the protein's activity, either enhancing or inhibiting its function. Allosteric modulation is a key mechanism in the control of enzymes, receptors, and ion channels, allowing for fine-tuned regulation of biological processes in biotechnology and neurotechnology.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, allosteric modulators are used to control enzyme activity, design drugs with improved specificity, and develop biosensors. In neurotechnology, allosteric modulation of neurotransmitter receptors is targeted to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Techniques such as structural biology, computational modeling, and high-throughput screening are employed to identify and optimize allosteric modulators for research and therapeutic applications. Advances in this field continue to expand the range of targets and strategies for modulating biological systems.</p>
