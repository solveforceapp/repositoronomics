    <h1>Aerobic Respiration</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Aerobic respiration is a metabolic process in which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. This process occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and is the primary means by which organisms generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell. Aerobic respiration is more efficient than anaerobic respiration, yielding up to 36 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. It is essential for the survival of most multicellular organisms, including humans, and underpins many physiological processes.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, aerobic respiration is harnessed in bioprocessing, fermentation, and the production of biofuels. Understanding this process is crucial for optimizing cell culture conditions, metabolic engineering, and the development of therapies for mitochondrial diseases. In neurotechnology, aerobic respiration is studied for its role in brain energy metabolism, neurodegeneration, and the effects of hypoxia on neural function. Advances in imaging, genomics, and metabolic modeling continue to expand our understanding of aerobic respiration and its applications in health, industry, and research.</p>
