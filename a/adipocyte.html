      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An adipocyte, or fat cell, is a specialized cell that stores energy in the form of lipids. Adipocytes are found in adipose tissue and play key roles in energy metabolism, hormone production, and insulation. There are two main types: white adipocytes, which store fat, and brown adipocytes, which generate heat through thermogenesis. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, adipocytes are studied for their roles in obesity, metabolic diseases, and the interaction between metabolism and brain function.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Adipocytes are central to research on obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Techniques such as cell culture, gene editing, and imaging are used to study adipocyte biology and develop therapies for metabolic disorders. In neurotechnology, the relationship between adipocytes and neural circuits is explored to understand how metabolism influences brain function and behavior. Advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine leverage adipocytes for reconstructive surgery and the development of artificial tissues. Understanding adipocyte function also informs the design of biomaterials and drug delivery systems targeting metabolic pathways.</p>
