      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Microsoft Azure is a leading cloud computing platform and service suite developed by Microsoft, offering a vast array of solutions for computing, storage, networking, databases, analytics, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. Launched in 2010, Azure has grown to become one of the world’s largest and most trusted cloud ecosystems, with data centers spanning the globe. Azure provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models, enabling organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications at scale. The platform supports a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and operating systems, making it highly versatile for developers and enterprises. Azure’s security, compliance, and hybrid capabilities are designed to meet the needs of regulated industries and complex IT environments, while its pay-as-you-go pricing model offers flexibility and cost control.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Azure is used by businesses, governments, and startups for a multitude of purposes, including cloud migration, application hosting, disaster recovery, data analytics, and digital transformation. For example, a global retailer may use Azure to run its e-commerce platform, leveraging scalable compute resources and global content delivery networks to serve customers worldwide. Healthcare organizations use Azure’s secure infrastructure to store and analyze patient data, supporting compliance with regulations like HIPAA. Azure’s hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities allow organizations to integrate on-premises systems with cloud services, supporting DevOps practices and agile development. Advanced analytics and AI services enable businesses to gain insights from big data, automate processes, and deliver personalized experiences. Azure also supports IoT deployments, blockchain solutions, and edge computing, making it a cornerstone of modern digital infrastructure. With continuous innovation and a robust partner ecosystem, Azure empowers organizations to accelerate growth, improve resilience, and stay competitive in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.</p>
