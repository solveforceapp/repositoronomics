    <h1>Beta-Lactamase</h1>

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Beta-lactamase is an enzyme produced by certain bacteria that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring of beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. The production of beta-lactamase is a major mechanism of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Beta-lactamases are diverse in structure and substrate specificity, and their genes can be transferred between bacteria via plasmids and other mobile genetic elements.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, beta-lactamase genes are used as selectable markers in genetic engineering, and beta-lactamase inhibitors are developed to restore the efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics. In neurotechnology, beta-lactamase activity is studied for its impact on the microbiome and potential effects on brain health. Advances in molecular biology, structural biology, and drug development continue to expand our understanding and management of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in medicine and research.</p>
