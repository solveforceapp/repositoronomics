      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An astrocyte is a type of glial cell found in the central nervous system (CNS) that supports and protects neurons. Astrocytes maintain the blood-brain barrier, regulate neurotransmitter levels, provide metabolic support, and modulate synaptic activity. They play essential roles in brain development, function, and response to injury or disease. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, astrocytes are studied for their involvement in neurological disorders, brain repair, and the development of neural interfaces.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, astrocytes are targeted for therapies aimed at promoting brain repair, reducing neuroinflammation, and improving neural interface integration. In biotechnology, astrocytes are used in cell culture models, drug screening, and the study of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, epilepsy, and glioma. Techniques such as immunohistochemistry, live-cell imaging, and genetic engineering are used to study and manipulate astrocyte function. Advances in stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine continue to expand the applications of astrocytes in research and therapy.</p>
