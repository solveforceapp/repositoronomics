<h1>Active Site</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>The active site is a specific region on an enzyme where substrate molecules bind and undergo a chemical reaction. It is typically a pocket or groove on the enzyme's surface, formed by a unique arrangement of amino acids that create a highly selective environment for substrate recognition and catalysis. The active site's shape, charge, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties determine the enzyme's specificity and efficiency. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, understanding the structure and function of active sites is crucial for designing drugs, engineering enzymes, and developing biosensors.</p>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <p>Active sites are central to the function of enzymes in metabolic pathways, signal transduction, and cellular regulation. In drug discovery, researchers design molecules that can bind to active sites to inhibit or activate enzyme activity, leading to new therapies for diseases. In neurotechnology, active sites are targeted to modulate neurotransmitter synthesis, degradation, or receptor function. Techniques such as X-ray crystallography, molecular modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis are used to study and manipulate active sites for industrial, medical, and research applications. Advances in protein engineering continue to expand the utility of active sites in synthetic biology and therapeutic development.</p>
