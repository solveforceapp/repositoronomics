      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Achromatopsia is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of color vision, resulting from dysfunction or absence of cone photoreceptors in the retina. Individuals with achromatopsia experience reduced visual acuity, extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia), and difficulty seeing in bright conditions. The condition is typically present from birth and is caused by mutations in genes involved in the development and function of cone cells. Achromatopsia is distinct from color blindness, which usually involves the loss of specific color perception rather than total color vision loss.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, achromatopsia is studied to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying vision and retinal diseases. Research on achromatopsia has led to the development of gene therapies, retinal implants, and assistive devices aimed at restoring or compensating for lost visual function. Animal models and patient-derived cells are used to test new treatments and explore the potential for regenerative medicine. Advances in imaging, optogenetics, and neuroprosthetics continue to improve the diagnosis, management, and quality of life for individuals with achromatopsia and related visual disorders.</p>
