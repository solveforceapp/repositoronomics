      <h1>Access Point</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An Access Point (AP) is a networking hardware device that allows Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network. It acts as a central transmitter and receiver of wireless radio signals, enabling wireless communication within a local area network (LAN).</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Access Points are commonly used in homes, offices, and public spaces to provide wireless internet access. In enterprise environments, multiple APs are deployed to ensure seamless coverage and support for a large number of users and devices. They are essential for enabling mobility, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies, and IoT connectivity.</p>
