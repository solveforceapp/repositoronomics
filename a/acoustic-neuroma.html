    <h1>Acoustic Neuroma</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An acoustic neuroma, also known as vestibular schwannoma, is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibulocochlear nerve, which transmits sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Although non-cancerous, acoustic neuromas can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, balance problems, and, if left untreated, may compress adjacent brain structures. The tumor arises from Schwann cells, which produce the myelin sheath around nerves. Acoustic neuromas are typically slow-growing and are diagnosed using imaging techniques such as MRI.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, acoustic neuromas are studied to improve diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, and non-invasive treatment options such as radiosurgery. Research focuses on understanding the genetic and molecular factors that contribute to tumor development and progression. Advances in neuroimaging, molecular diagnostics, and targeted therapies are enhancing the management and prognosis of patients with acoustic neuroma, reducing the risk of complications and improving quality of life.</p>
