      <h1>Block of Code</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A block of code is a group of program statements that are treated as a single unit, often enclosed within curly braces {} or indentation. Blocks of code define the scope of variables and control structures in programming languages.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Blocks of code are fundamental in programming for organizing logic, controlling flow, and managing variable scope. They are used in functions, loops, conditionals, and classes to structure software in a readable and maintainable way.</p>
