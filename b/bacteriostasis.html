      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Bacteriostasis is the inhibition of bacterial growth and reproduction without killing the bacteria. This process can be achieved through the use of bacteriostatic agents, environmental conditions, or immune responses. Bacteriostasis is reversible; when the inhibitory agent is removed, bacteria can resume growth. It is a key concept in microbiology, biotechnology, and medicine for controlling bacterial populations.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, bacteriostatic agents are used in food preservation, pharmaceuticals, and laboratory research to control contamination and extend shelf life. In neurotechnology, bacteriostasis is relevant to the development of antimicrobial coatings for neural implants and devices. Understanding bacteriostasis informs the design of antibiotics, disinfectants, and strategies for managing infections. Advances in molecular biology, materials science, and synthetic biology continue to expand the applications of bacteriostasis in science, industry, and healthcare.</p>
