      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Aztreonam is a monobactam antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to cell death. Aztreonam is notable for its resistance to many beta-lactamases and its use in patients with allergies to other beta-lactam antibiotics. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, aztreonam is studied for its mechanism of action, resistance profiles, and applications in clinical and research settings.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, aztreonam is used in antimicrobial susceptibility testing, drug development, and the study of bacterial physiology. In neurotechnology, aztreonam is investigated for its effects on the microbiome, potential neuroprotective properties, and use in treating infections in immunocompromised patients. Advances in medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical microbiology continue to expand the applications of aztreonam in medicine and research.</p>
