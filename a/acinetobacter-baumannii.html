      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative, opportunistic bacterium known for causing hospital-acquired infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. It is notorious for its ability to develop resistance to multiple antibiotics, making infections difficult to treat. A. baumannii can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound infections, and urinary tract infections. Its resilience in hospital environments and capacity for rapid genetic adaptation have made it a focus of research in microbiology, infectious disease, and biotechnology.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, Acinetobacter baumannii is studied to understand mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and pathogenicity. Research aims to develop new antimicrobial agents, diagnostic tools, and infection control strategies. In neurotechnology, infections caused by A. baumannii can complicate neurosurgical procedures and the use of neural implants, highlighting the need for effective sterilization and monitoring protocols. Advances in genomics, molecular biology, and drug discovery are critical for combating the threat posed by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in healthcare settings.</p>
