    <h1>5S Ribosomal RNA</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) is a small, highly conserved RNA molecule, approximately 120 nucleotides in length, that forms an integral part of the large subunit of ribosomes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It plays a crucial role in the structure and function of the ribosome, contributing to the stabilization of the ribosomal complex and the proper alignment of transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) during protein synthesis. The sequence and structure of 5S rRNA are remarkably conserved across species, reflecting its essential role in cellular biology.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, 5S rRNA is used as a molecular marker for phylogenetic studies, species identification, and evolutionary research. Its stability and abundance make it a valuable reference in gene expression analysis and ribosome profiling. In neurobiology, alterations in ribosomal RNA, including 5S rRNA, have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying brain function and pathology. Advances in RNA sequencing and structural biology continue to reveal new aspects of 5S rRNA’s role in health and disease, making it a subject of ongoing research in both fundamental and applied biosciences.</p>
