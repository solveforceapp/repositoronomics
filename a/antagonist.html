    <h1>Antagonist</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An antagonist is a molecule that binds to a receptor but does not activate it, thereby blocking or dampening the action of an agonist or natural ligand. Antagonists are widely used in biotechnology and neurotechnology to study receptor function, signal transduction, and to develop drugs that modulate physiological processes for therapeutic benefit.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, antagonists are used to inhibit neural pathways, study brain function, and treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. In biotechnology, antagonists are developed as therapeutics for conditions such as hypertension, pain, and cancer. Techniques such as high-throughput screening, molecular modeling, and pharmacological assays are used to identify and characterize antagonists for research and clinical applications. Advances in synthetic biology and drug design continue to expand the range of antagonists available for targeting diverse biological systems.</p>
