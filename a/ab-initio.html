    <h1>Ab Initio</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Ab initio is a computational approach in molecular biology and biotechnology that predicts the structure and properties of molecules from first principles, without relying on empirical data. The method involves solving the Schrödinger equation for atoms and molecules, enabling the modeling of atomic interactions, molecular conformations, and reaction mechanisms. Ab initio techniques are fundamental to quantum chemistry, structural biology, and the design of novel biomolecules, providing insights into the behavior of complex biological systems at the atomic level.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, ab initio modeling is used to predict protein structures, design enzymes, and simulate molecular interactions for drug discovery. In neurotechnology, it aids in understanding the atomic-level mechanisms of neural receptors, ion channels, and signaling molecules. The approach is also applied in materials science to design biomaterials and nanodevices with specific properties. Advances in computational power and algorithms have expanded the scope of ab initio methods, making them indispensable tools for innovation in both fundamental research and applied biosciences.</p>
