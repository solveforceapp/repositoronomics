      <h1>C Terms</h1>
      <h2>Cache Coherency</h2>
      <p>Cache coherency is the process of keeping data in multiple caches synchronized in a multiprocessor shared memory system. When one processor updates a memory location, all other caches must reflect that change to maintain data consistency. Coherency protocols, such as MESI, are essential for correct operation in modern multicore CPUs and distributed systems.</p>
      <h2>Cache Eviction</h2>
      <p>Cache eviction is the process of removing data from a cache to make room for new entries. Eviction policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or First-In-First-Out (FIFO), determine which data is discarded. Effective cache eviction improves performance by maximizing cache hit rates and minimizing memory access latency.</p>
      <h2>Cache Hit</h2>
      <p>A cache hit occurs when requested data is found in a local cache, avoiding the need to access slower main memory or storage. High cache hit rates are critical for system performance, especially in CPUs, databases, and web applications.</p>
      <h2>Cache Line</h2>
      <p>A cache line is a small block of memory within a cache, typically 32–128 bytes in size. Data is transferred between main memory and cache in cache line units, optimizing memory access patterns and reducing latency.</p>
      <h2>Cache Miss</h2>
      <p>A cache miss occurs when requested data is not found in the cache, requiring retrieval from a slower memory tier. Cache misses can degrade performance, making cache design and management crucial in computing systems.</p>
      <h2>Cache Thrashing</h2>
      <p>Cache thrashing is a pathological situation where frequent cache misses occur due to poor access patterns, causing data to be repeatedly evicted and reloaded. Thrashing reduces system efficiency and can be mitigated by optimizing algorithms and cache policies.</p>
      <h2>Cache Ways</h2>
