      <h1>Algorithm</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An algorithm is a precise, step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. In the context of computing and information technology, algorithms are the backbone of all software and digital processes. They can be as simple as sorting a list of numbers or as complex as powering artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Algorithms are expressed in programming languages and implemented in code, but the underlying logic is independent of any specific technology. The effectiveness of an algorithm is measured by its correctness (does it solve the problem?), efficiency (how much time and resources does it use?), and scalability (can it handle larger inputs?). Algorithms are classified into various types, such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, cryptographic, and optimization algorithms. The design and analysis of algorithms is a core discipline in computer science, influencing everything from hardware architecture to user experience.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Algorithms are omnipresent in modern IT and telecommunications. Search engines like Google use sophisticated algorithms to rank web pages and deliver relevant results in milliseconds. In cybersecurity, encryption algorithms protect sensitive data by transforming it into unreadable formats for unauthorized users. Network routing algorithms determine the most efficient paths for data packets to travel across the internet. In artificial intelligence, algorithms enable machines to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions—powering applications such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. The choice of algorithm can dramatically impact the performance, security, and reliability of a system. For example, a financial trading platform relies on high-frequency trading algorithms to execute orders in microseconds, while a healthcare application may use diagnostic algorithms to analyze medical images. As technology evolves, the development of new and improved algorithms remains a driving force behind innovation and digital transformation.</p>
