      <h2>Gateway</h2>
      <p>A gateway is a network node that serves as an access point to another network, often translating protocols and managing traffic between different systems. Gateways are essential in telecommunications, cloud services, and enterprise networks, enabling interoperability and secure data exchange.</p>
      <h2>Gigabit Ethernet</h2>
      <p>Gigabit Ethernet is a high-speed networking standard that supports data transfer rates of 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). It is widely used in local area networks (LANs) for fast, reliable communication between computers, servers, and network devices.</p>
      <h2>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h2>
      <p>A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering and parallel computations. GPUs are critical in gaming, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning applications.</p>
      <h2>GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)</h2>
      <p>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a mobile data service that enables wireless data transmission over cellular networks. GPRS paved the way for mobile internet, multimedia messaging, and IoT connectivity.</p>
      <h2>Green Computing</h2>
      <p>Green computing refers to environmentally sustainable computing practices, including energy-efficient hardware, responsible e-waste disposal, and eco-friendly data centers. Green IT initiatives reduce carbon footprints and promote resource conservation.</p>
      <h2>Grid Computing</h2>
      <p>Grid computing is a distributed computing model that connects multiple computers to work together on complex tasks, sharing resources and processing power. It is used in scientific research, financial modeling, and large-scale simulations.</p>
      <h2>GUI (Graphical User Interface)</h2>
      <p>A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a visual interface that allows users to interact with computers and software using graphical elements like windows, icons, and menus. GUIs make technology accessible and user-friendly.</p>
      <h2>Gigabyte (GB)</h2>
      <p>A gigabyte is a unit of digital information equal to 1,024 megabytes (MB) or approximately one billion bytes. Gigabytes are commonly used to measure storage capacity in computers, smartphones, and cloud services.</p>
      <h2>GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)</h2>
      <p>GSM is a standard for mobile networks that enables voice and data communication worldwide. It supports international roaming, text messaging, and secure mobile connectivity.</p>
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <p>Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It enables collaboration, branching, and history management, and is the foundation for platforms like GitHub and GitLab.</p>
