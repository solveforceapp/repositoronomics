      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Androgens are a group of steroid hormones that regulate the development and maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates. The most well-known androgen is testosterone. Androgens influence a wide range of physiological processes, including reproductive function, muscle growth, bone density, and behavior. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, androgens are studied for their roles in health, disease, and the development of therapeutics targeting hormonal pathways.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, androgens are used in hormone replacement therapy, the treatment of certain cancers, and the study of endocrine disorders. In neurotechnology, androgens are investigated for their effects on brain development, cognition, and behavior. Research into androgen signaling informs the design of drugs, gene therapies, and diagnostic tools for a variety of medical conditions. Advances in molecular biology, pharmacology, and endocrinology continue to expand our understanding and application of androgens in science and medicine.</p>
