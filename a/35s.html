    <h1>35S (Sulfur-35)</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>35S, or Sulfur-35, is a radioactive isotope of sulfur used extensively in molecular biology and biotechnology for labeling biomolecules. With a half-life of about 87.5 days, 35S emits low-energy beta particles, making it suitable for sensitive detection in autoradiography and scintillation counting. 35S is commonly incorporated into proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules to study their synthesis, localization, and interactions. Its use requires careful handling and adherence to radiation safety protocols to protect researchers and the environment from exposure.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, 35S is used to investigate protein synthesis, gene expression, and metabolic pathways. It enables the tracking of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine, in protein labeling experiments. In neurobiology, 35S-labeled compounds help elucidate the dynamics of neurotransmitter synthesis, receptor binding, and signal transduction in the brain. The isotope is also used in diagnostic assays, drug development, and the study of disease mechanisms. While non-radioactive alternatives are available, 35S remains a valuable tool for high-sensitivity research, particularly in applications requiring precise quantification and localization of biomolecules.</p>
