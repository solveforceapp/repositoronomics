    <h1>Activation Energy</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required to initiate a chemical reaction. It represents the energy barrier that reactants must overcome to be transformed into products. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, activation energy is a key parameter in enzymology, metabolic engineering, and the design of biochemical assays. Enzymes and catalysts function by lowering the activation energy, thereby increasing the rate of reactions essential for life and technology.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, understanding activation energy is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions, designing efficient enzymes, and developing industrial bioprocesses. In neurotechnology, activation energy concepts are applied to the study of neurotransmitter release, ion channel gating, and the energetics of neural signaling. Techniques such as calorimetry, kinetic modeling, and computational chemistry are used to measure and manipulate activation energy in research and development. Advances in enzyme engineering, drug design, and systems biology continue to leverage activation energy principles to drive innovation in life sciences and brain research.</p>
