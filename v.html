      <h2>VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)</h2>
      <p>A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical segmentation of a physical network, allowing devices to be grouped together regardless of their physical location. VLANs improve network management, security, and performance in enterprise environments.</p>
      <h2>VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)</h2>
      <p>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that enables voice communication and multimedia sessions over the internet. VoIP reduces costs, supports mobility, and integrates with other digital services.</p>
      <h2>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</h2>
      <p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network, allowing users to access resources remotely and protect their data from interception. VPNs are essential for privacy, security, and remote work.</p>
      <h2>Virtualization</h2>
      <p>Virtualization is the creation of virtual versions of physical resources, such as servers, storage, or networks. It enables efficient resource utilization, scalability, and isolation in data centers and cloud computing.</p>
      <h2>Virus</h2>
      <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software that attaches itself to legitimate programs and spreads to other systems. Viruses can corrupt data, steal information, and disrupt operations. Antivirus software helps detect and remove viruses.</p>
      <h2>Version Control</h2>
      <p>Version control is a system that tracks changes to files and code, enabling collaboration, rollback, and history management. Tools like Git and Subversion are widely used in software development.</p>
      <h2>VNC (Virtual Network Computing)</h2>
      <p>Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote desktop technology that allows users to control another computer over a network. VNC is used for technical support, remote administration, and collaboration.</p>
      <h2>Voice Recognition</h2>
      <p>Voice recognition is a technology that converts spoken language into text or commands. It is used in virtual assistants, transcription services, and accessibility tools.</p>
      <h2>Volatile Memory</h2>
      <p>Volatile memory is computer memory that requires power to maintain stored data. RAM is the most common type of volatile memory, used for temporary data storage during operation.</p>
      <h2>Vulnerability</h2>
      <p>A vulnerability is a weakness in software, hardware, or processes that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause harm. Vulnerability management is critical for cybersecurity.</p>
