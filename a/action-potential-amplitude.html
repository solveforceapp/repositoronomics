    <h1>Action Potential Amplitude</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Action potential amplitude refers to the maximum voltage reached during an action potential, typically measured as the difference between the resting membrane potential and the peak of the action potential. In neurons, this value is usually around 70–100 millivolts. The amplitude is determined by the properties of ion channels, membrane resistance, and the ionic gradients across the cell membrane. It is a key parameter in assessing the excitability and health of neurons and muscle cells.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, measuring action potential amplitude is essential for evaluating the function of neural circuits, the effects of drugs or toxins, and the performance of neural implants. Changes in amplitude can indicate alterations in ion channel function, membrane integrity, or synaptic input. Techniques such as patch-clamp electrophysiology, multi-electrode arrays, and computational modeling are used to study action potential amplitude in research and clinical diagnostics. Understanding and controlling action potential amplitude supports the development of therapies for neurological diseases, the design of brain-computer interfaces, and the advancement of neuroprosthetic devices.</p>
