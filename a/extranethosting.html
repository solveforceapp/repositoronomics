    <h1>Extranet Hosting</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Extranet hosting is a service that provides the infrastructure and security necessary to support extranet environments, enabling organizations to share specific resources with external partners over the internet. This hosting can be managed internally or outsourced to third-party providers, and typically includes secure web servers, authentication systems, and network segmentation to isolate extranet resources from the main corporate network.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Organizations use extranet hosting to facilitate collaboration with partners, suppliers, or customers without exposing their entire internal network. For example, a healthcare provider may use extranet hosting to allow insurance companies secure access to patient billing information. The hosting provider ensures uptime, security, and compliance with relevant regulations, making it easier for businesses to extend their digital ecosystem safely.</p>
