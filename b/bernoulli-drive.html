      <h1>Bernoulli Drive</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A Bernoulli Drive is a high-capacity removable floppy disk drive developed by Iomega in the 1980s. It used the Bernoulli principle to keep the disk from touching the read/write head, reducing wear and increasing reliability compared to traditional floppy drives.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Bernoulli Drives were used for data backup and transfer in personal computers and workstations before the advent of more modern storage solutions. They provided a reliable, portable option for large data storage in their era.</p>
