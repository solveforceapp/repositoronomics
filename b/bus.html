      <h1>Bus</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers. It consists of a set of physical connections, such as wires or traces, that enable the exchange of information.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Buses are fundamental in computer architecture, enabling CPUs, memory, and peripherals to communicate efficiently. In telecommunications, bus systems are used in network backbones and device interconnections, supporting scalable and modular system designs.</p>
