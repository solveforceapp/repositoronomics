      <h2>RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)</h2>
      <p>RAID is a data storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit for redundancy, performance, or both. Different RAID levels (e.g., RAID 0, 1, 5, 10) offer various balances of speed, fault tolerance, and capacity.</p>
      <h2>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
      <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of volatile memory used by computers to store data temporarily for quick access. RAM is essential for multitasking, application performance, and overall system speed.</p>
      <h2>Ransomware</h2>
      <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim’s data and demands payment for its release. Ransomware attacks can cause significant financial and operational damage to individuals and organizations.</p>
      <h2>Remote Desktop</h2>
      <p>Remote Desktop is a technology that allows users to access and control a computer from a remote location over a network. It is widely used for technical support, telecommuting, and server management.</p>
      <h2>Repository</h2>
      <p>A repository is a central location where data, code, or digital assets are stored and managed. In software development, repositories are used for version control, collaboration, and deployment.</p>
      <h2>Resilience</h2>
      <p>Resilience in IT refers to the ability of a system or network to recover quickly from failures, disruptions, or attacks. Resilient systems are designed for high availability, disaster recovery, and business continuity.</p>
      <h2>Router</h2>
      <p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks, directing traffic efficiently and securely. Routers are essential for connecting local networks to the internet and managing network traffic.</p>
      <h2>Rootkit</h2>
      <p>A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access to a computer system and conceal its presence. Rootkits are used by attackers to maintain persistent control and evade detection.</p>
      <h2>Runtime Environment</h2>
      <p>A runtime environment is the infrastructure that supports the execution of software applications, providing necessary resources, libraries, and services. Examples include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR).</p>
      <h2>Redundancy</h2>
      <p>Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components, systems, or processes to ensure continued operation in case of failure. Redundancy is critical in data centers, networks, and mission-critical applications for reliability and uptime.</p>
