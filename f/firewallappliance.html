    <h1>Firewall Appliance</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A firewall appliance is a dedicated hardware device designed to protect networks by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. Unlike software firewalls, appliances are purpose-built for high performance and reliability, often including advanced features like intrusion prevention, VPN support, and content filtering.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Firewall appliances are deployed at network perimeters in businesses, data centers, and ISPs to block unauthorized access and cyber threats. For example, a company may use a firewall appliance to segment its internal network from the internet, ensuring only legitimate traffic is allowed and sensitive data is protected.</p>
