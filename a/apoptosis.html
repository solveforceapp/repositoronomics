    <h1>Apoptosis</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death characterized by specific morphological and biochemical changes, including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. It is a tightly regulated process essential for development, tissue homeostasis, and the elimination of damaged or diseased cells. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, apoptosis is studied for its roles in disease, therapy, and the design of targeted interventions.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, apoptosis is targeted in cancer therapy, regenerative medicine, and the development of drugs that modulate cell survival. In neurotechnology, apoptosis is investigated for its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, brain injury, and neural development. Techniques such as flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, and live-cell imaging are used to study apoptosis in research and clinical settings. Advances in molecular biology, genetics, and pharmacology continue to expand our understanding and manipulation of apoptosis for therapeutic benefit.</p>
