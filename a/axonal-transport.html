    <h1>Axonal Transport</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Axonal transport is the process by which materials such as proteins, organelles, and signaling molecules are moved along the axons of neurons. This transport is essential for the maintenance, function, and survival of neurons, enabling communication between the cell body and distant synaptic terminals. Axonal transport occurs in both directions: anterograde (from the cell body to the axon terminal) and retrograde (from the axon terminal to the cell body).</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, axonal transport is studied to understand neural development, synaptic function, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease. In biotechnology, axonal transport mechanisms are leveraged for targeted drug delivery, gene therapy, and the development of neural prosthetics. Techniques such as live-cell imaging, molecular labeling, and genetic manipulation are used to study and manipulate axonal transport for research and therapeutic applications. Advances in cell biology, imaging, and nanotechnology continue to expand our understanding and application of axonal transport in science and medicine.</p>
