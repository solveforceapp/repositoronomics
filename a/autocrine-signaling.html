    <h1>Autocrine Signaling</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Autocrine signaling is a form of cell communication in which a cell produces signaling molecules that bind to receptors on its own surface, leading to changes in its own behavior or function. This type of signaling allows cells to regulate their own growth, differentiation, and survival. Autocrine signaling is important in development, immune responses, and the progression of diseases such as cancer.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, autocrine signaling is studied to understand cell fate decisions, develop targeted therapies, and engineer synthetic biological systems. In neurotechnology, autocrine signaling is investigated for its roles in neural development, synaptic plasticity, and the response to injury or disease. Techniques such as live-cell imaging, genetic engineering, and molecular assays are used to study and manipulate autocrine signaling for research and therapeutic applications. Advances in systems biology, regenerative medicine, and immunotherapy continue to expand the applications of autocrine signaling in science and medicine.</p>
