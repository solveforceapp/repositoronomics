    <h1>Alpha Helix</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An alpha helix is a common structural motif in proteins, characterized by a right-handed coiled or spiral conformation stabilized by hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms. This secondary structure is fundamental to the folding, stability, and function of many proteins in biotechnology and neurotechnology. Alpha helices contribute to the formation of transmembrane domains, DNA-binding regions, and protein-protein interaction interfaces.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, understanding alpha helix structure is essential for protein engineering, drug design, and the development of synthetic peptides. In neurotechnology, alpha helices are studied in the context of ion channels, receptors, and signaling proteins involved in neural function. Techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and computational modeling are used to analyze and manipulate alpha helices for research and therapeutic purposes. Advances in structural biology continue to reveal new roles for alpha helices in health and disease.</p>
