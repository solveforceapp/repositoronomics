    <h1>Action Potential</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An action potential is a rapid, transient electrical signal that travels along the membrane of a neuron or muscle cell. It is generated by the movement of ions across the cell membrane through voltage-gated ion channels, resulting in a temporary reversal of membrane potential. Action potentials are fundamental to the transmission of information in the nervous system, enabling communication between neurons, muscles, and other tissues. The process involves depolarization, repolarization, and a refractory period, ensuring unidirectional signal propagation.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, action potentials are studied to understand neural signaling, brain function, and the mechanisms underlying sensory perception, movement, and cognition. Techniques such as patch-clamp recording, electrophysiology, and optogenetics are used to measure and manipulate action potentials in research and clinical settings. Insights into action potential dynamics inform the development of neural prosthetics, brain-computer interfaces, and treatments for neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and arrhythmias. Advances in imaging, modeling, and device engineering continue to expand our ability to monitor and control action potentials for therapeutic and research applications.</p>
