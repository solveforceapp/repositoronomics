      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Acrylamide gel is a synthetic polymer matrix used as the medium for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), a technique for separating proteins, nucleic acids, or other biomolecules based on size and charge. The gel is formed by the polymerization of acrylamide and a cross-linker, creating a porous structure that allows molecules to migrate under an electric field. The concentration and composition of the gel can be adjusted to optimize resolution for different types of samples.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, acrylamide gels are essential for protein and DNA analysis, purification, and characterization. They are used in research, diagnostics, and quality control to assess molecular weight, purity, and post-translational modifications. In neurotechnology, acrylamide gels support studies of neural proteins, synaptic components, and disease biomarkers. Advances in gel chemistry, staining techniques, and imaging systems continue to enhance the sensitivity, speed, and versatility of acrylamide gel electrophoresis in life sciences and brain research.</p>
