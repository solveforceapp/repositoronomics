      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An agonist is a molecule that binds to a receptor and activates it, mimicking the action of a natural ligand. Agonists can be endogenous (produced by the body) or exogenous (introduced as drugs or chemicals). In biotechnology and neurotechnology, agonists are used to study receptor function, signal transduction, and the development of therapeutics targeting specific pathways.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Agonists are central to drug development, enabling the modulation of physiological processes for therapeutic benefit. In neurotechnology, agonists are used to activate neural circuits, study brain function, and develop treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Techniques such as high-throughput screening, molecular modeling, and electrophysiology are used to identify and characterize agonists for research and clinical applications. Advances in synthetic biology and pharmacology continue to expand the range of agonists available for targeting diverse biological systems.</p>
