    <h1>Attenuation</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Attenuation refers to the reduction in the strength, intensity, or amplitude of a signal, wave, or biological response as it passes through a medium or system. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, attenuation is relevant to the transmission of electrical, optical, or biochemical signals, as well as the regulation of gene expression and metabolic pathways. Attenuation can result from absorption, scattering, or other physical and biological processes.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, attenuation is important for understanding the propagation of neural signals, the design of brain-computer interfaces, and the development of neural prosthetics. In biotechnology, attenuation is used to create live attenuated vaccines, optimize signal detection in assays, and control gene expression in synthetic biology. Techniques such as electrophysiology, spectroscopy, and molecular engineering are used to study and manipulate attenuation for research, clinical, and industrial applications. Advances in materials science, electronics, and systems biology continue to expand the applications of attenuation in science and technology.</p>
