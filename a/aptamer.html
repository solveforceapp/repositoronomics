      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An aptamer is a short, single-stranded DNA or RNA molecule that can bind to specific targets, such as proteins, small molecules, or cells, with high affinity and specificity. Aptamers are selected from large libraries using a process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment). In biotechnology and neurotechnology, aptamers are used as molecular recognition elements in diagnostics, therapeutics, and research tools.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, aptamers are used in biosensors, targeted drug delivery, and the development of novel therapeutics. In neurotechnology, aptamers are explored for their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, target neural proteins, and modulate brain function. Techniques such as SELEX, high-throughput screening, and structural analysis are used to identify and optimize aptamers for specific applications. Advances in synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and molecular engineering continue to expand the utility of aptamers in science and medicine.</p>
