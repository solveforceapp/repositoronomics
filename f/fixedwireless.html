    <h1>Fixed Wireless</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Fixed wireless is a type of broadband internet access that uses radio signals to connect two fixed locations, such as a home or business and a service provider’s tower. It eliminates the need for physical cables, offering high-speed connectivity in areas where wired infrastructure is impractical.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Fixed wireless is used to deliver internet service in rural or underserved regions, provide backup connectivity, and support temporary installations. For example, a business in a remote area may use fixed wireless to access high-speed internet without waiting for fiber deployment.</p>
