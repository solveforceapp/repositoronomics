      <h1>Broadband</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Broadband is a term used to describe high-speed, always-on internet access that is significantly faster than traditional dial-up connections. It encompasses a range of technologies, including Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modem, fiber-optic, satellite, and wireless broadband (such as 4G, 5G, and fixed wireless). Broadband connections provide rapid data transmission, enabling users to download and upload large files, stream high-definition video, participate in video conferences, and access cloud-based applications with minimal delay. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States currently defines broadband as having minimum download speeds of 25 Mbps and upload speeds of 3 Mbps, though these benchmarks continue to rise as technology advances. Broadband infrastructure is a critical enabler of digital transformation, economic growth, and social inclusion, bridging the digital divide between urban and rural communities.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Broadband is essential for modern communications, supporting a wide array of applications in business, education, healthcare, and entertainment. Businesses rely on broadband for cloud computing, remote work, online collaboration, and e-commerce. Schools and universities use broadband to deliver online courses, virtual classrooms, and digital resources to students worldwide. Telemedicine leverages broadband to connect patients with healthcare providers, enabling remote consultations and real-time monitoring. In the home, broadband powers smart devices, streaming services, and online gaming. Governments invest in broadband infrastructure to promote economic development, improve public services, and enhance emergency response capabilities. The expansion of fiber-optic networks and the rollout of 5G wireless are driving even greater speeds and capacity, paving the way for innovations such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, and autonomous vehicles. Ensuring affordable, reliable broadband access for all is a key policy goal in many countries, as it underpins participation in the digital economy and society.</p>
