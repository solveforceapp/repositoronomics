      <h1>Botnet</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>A botnet is a network of computers, devices, or “bots” that have been compromised by malicious software and are remotely controlled by a cybercriminal, known as a botmaster. These infected devices, which can include PCs, servers, IoT gadgets, and smartphones, operate without the knowledge of their owners. Botnets are created by spreading malware through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once under the botmaster’s control, the bots can be coordinated to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam emails, stealing sensitive data, or mining cryptocurrency. Botnets can range in size from a few hundred to millions of devices, making them powerful tools for cybercriminals. Advanced botnets use techniques like peer-to-peer communication, encryption, and fast-flux DNS to evade detection and takedown efforts. The global reach and anonymity of the internet make botnets a persistent and evolving threat in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Botnets are a major concern for organizations, governments, and individuals due to their versatility and destructive potential. DDoS attacks orchestrated by botnets can overwhelm websites, online services, or critical infrastructure, causing downtime and financial losses. Cybercriminals use botnets to distribute ransomware, steal login credentials, and harvest personal information for identity theft or fraud. In the telecom sector, botnets can target network infrastructure, disrupt services, and facilitate large-scale spam campaigns. Security solutions focus on detecting, disrupting, and preventing botnet infections through network monitoring, endpoint protection, and threat intelligence sharing. Law enforcement agencies collaborate internationally to dismantle botnet operations and prosecute perpetrators. Users can protect themselves by keeping software updated, using strong passwords, and avoiding suspicious links or downloads. As the number of connected devices grows, the risk of botnet attacks increases, underscoring the need for robust cybersecurity practices and ongoing vigilance across all digital environments.</p>
