    <h1>ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is a nucleotide that serves as the primary energy carrier in all living cells. Composed of adenine, ribose, and three phosphate groups, ATP stores and transfers energy for numerous cellular processes, including metabolism, muscle contraction, and signal transduction. The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate releases energy that powers biological work. ATP is continuously regenerated through cellular respiration and photosynthesis.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, ATP is measured to assess cell viability, metabolic activity, and the efficacy of drugs or treatments. ATP-based assays are widely used in research, diagnostics, and industrial applications. In neurotechnology, ATP is crucial for neural signaling, synaptic transmission, and the maintenance of ion gradients in neurons and glial cells. Disruptions in ATP production or utilization are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, brain injury, and metabolic disorders. Advances in imaging, biosensors, and metabolic engineering continue to expand our understanding and manipulation of ATP dynamics for therapeutic and research purposes.</p>
