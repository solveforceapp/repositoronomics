    <h1>Firewall Detection</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Firewall detection refers to the process of identifying the presence and type of firewall protecting a network. This can be done by analyzing network responses, scanning for open ports, or using specialized tools to infer firewall rules and configurations.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Firewall detection is used by network administrators to verify security measures and by penetration testers to assess vulnerabilities. For example, a security team may use firewall detection tools to ensure that only intended services are exposed to the internet and that firewall policies are correctly enforced.</p>
