      <h1>O Terms</h1>
      <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
      <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and methods. OOP promotes modularity, code reuse, and abstraction, and is fundamental to languages like Java, C++, and Python.</p>
      <h2>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</h2>
      <p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper, PDFs, or images, into editable and searchable data. OCR is widely used in digitization and automation workflows.</p>
      <h2>OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)</h2>
      <p>An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) produces hardware or software that is sold to other companies for rebranding or integration into their own products. OEMs are key players in the technology supply chain.</p>
      <h2>Offsite Backup</h2>
      <p>Offsite backup is the practice of storing copies of data at a remote location to protect against data loss from disasters, theft, or hardware failure. Offsite backups are essential for business continuity and disaster recovery planning.</p>
      <h2>Open Source</h2>
      <p>Open source refers to software whose source code is freely available for use, modification, and distribution. Open source fosters collaboration, innovation, and transparency in software development.</p>
      <h2>Operating System (OS)</h2>
      <p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.</p>
      <h2>Optical Fiber</h2>
      <p>Optical fiber is a flexible, transparent fiber made of glass or plastic that transmits data as pulses of light. It is the backbone of high-speed internet, telecommunications, and data center networks.</p>
      <h2>Overclocking</h2>
      <p>Overclocking is the process of increasing the clock speed of a computer component, such as a CPU or GPU, beyond its factory settings to boost performance. Overclocking can improve speed but may increase heat and reduce hardware lifespan.</p>
      <h2>OAuth</h2>
      <p>OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords. OAuth is widely used in social login and API security.</p>
      <h2>Object Storage</h2>
      <p>Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, rather than files or blocks. It is highly scalable and used in cloud storage solutions for unstructured data like images, videos, and backups.</p>
