<h1>Bacterial Conjugation</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>Bacterial conjugation is a process by which genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another through direct cell-to-cell contact. This horizontal gene transfer mechanism involves the formation of a pilus, which connects donor and recipient cells, allowing the transfer of plasmids or other DNA elements. Conjugation contributes to genetic diversity, adaptation, and the spread of antibiotic resistance among bacterial populations.</p>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <p>In biotechnology, bacterial conjugation is harnessed for genetic engineering, the construction of recombinant strains, and the study of gene transfer mechanisms. In neurotechnology, conjugation is explored for its impact on the gut microbiome and its potential influence on brain health and disease. Advances in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and microbiome research continue to expand the applications of bacterial conjugation in science, medicine, and industry.</p>
