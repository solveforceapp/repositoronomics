      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Azurin is a small, blue copper protein found in certain bacteria, where it functions as an electron transfer agent in cellular respiration. Azurin has a characteristic blue color due to its copper center and is structurally related to other cupredoxins. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, azurin is studied for its electron transfer properties, potential anticancer activity, and use as a biosensor component.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, azurin is used in the development of biosensors, bioelectronic devices, and as a model for studying electron transfer in proteins. Research has shown that azurin can enter cancer cells and induce apoptosis, making it a candidate for anticancer therapy. In neurotechnology, azurin's electron transfer capabilities are explored for applications in neural interfaces and bioelectronic medicine. Advances in protein engineering, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology continue to expand the applications of azurin in science and medicine.</p>
