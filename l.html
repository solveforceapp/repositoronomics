      <h1>L Terms</h1>
      <h2>LAN (Local Area Network)</h2>
      <p>A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus. LANs enable resource sharing, communication, and centralized management, and are the foundation of most organizational IT infrastructures.</p>
      <h2>Latency</h2>
      <p>Latency is the delay between the initiation of an action and its observable effect, often measured in milliseconds. In networking, low latency is crucial for real-time applications like video conferencing, gaming, and VoIP.</p>
      <h2>Load Balancer</h2>
      <p>A load balancer is a device or software that distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability, scalability, and optimal resource utilization. Load balancing is essential for high-availability systems and cloud services.</p>
      <h2>Logic Gate</h2>
      <p>A logic gate is a fundamental building block of digital circuits, performing basic logical functions such as AND, OR, and NOT. Logic gates are used in processors, memory, and all digital electronics.</p>
      <h2>Login</h2>
      <p>Login is the process of authenticating a user’s identity to access a computer system, application, or network. Secure login mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, help protect against unauthorized access.</p>
      <h2>Loopback</h2>
      <p>Loopback is a network interface or address used to test and troubleshoot network software and hardware. The loopback address (127.0.0.1) allows a device to communicate with itself for diagnostics and development.</p>
      <h2>Lossless Compression</h2>
      <p>Lossless compression is a data compression method that preserves all original information, allowing exact reconstruction of the data. It is used for text, images, and files where data integrity is critical.</p>
      <h2>Low-Code</h2>
      <p>Low-code platforms enable rapid application development with minimal hand-coding, using visual interfaces and pre-built components. Low-code accelerates digital transformation and empowers non-developers to build solutions.</p>
      <h2>LTE (Long-Term Evolution)</h2>
      <p>LTE is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile devices and data terminals. It offers increased capacity, speed, and efficiency compared to previous cellular technologies, supporting modern mobile broadband.</p>
      <h2>Linux</h2>
      <p>Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that powers a wide range of devices, from servers and desktops to smartphones and embedded systems. Known for its stability, security, and flexibility, Linux is a cornerstone of modern computing and cloud infrastructure.</p>
