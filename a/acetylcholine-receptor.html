    <h1>Acetylcholine Receptor</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An acetylcholine receptor is a protein found on the surface of nerve and muscle cells that binds acetylcholine, triggering a cellular response. There are two main types: nicotinic receptors, which are ion channels, and muscarinic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors mediate the effects of acetylcholine in the nervous system, influencing muscle contraction, heart rate, and cognitive processes. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, acetylcholine receptors are studied for their roles in synaptic transmission, drug action, and neurological diseases.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, acetylcholine receptors are targets for drug discovery, screening, and the development of treatments for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and myasthenia gravis. In neurotechnology, they are used in the design of neural interfaces, biosensors, and neuromodulation devices. Research on acetylcholine receptors supports the development of precision medicines, brain-computer interfaces, and therapies for motor and cognitive disorders. Advances in structural biology, pharmacology, and bioengineering continue to expand the applications of acetylcholine receptors in life sciences and brain research.</p>
