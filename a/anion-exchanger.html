      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An anion exchanger is a membrane protein or synthetic material that facilitates the exchange of negatively charged ions (anions) across biological membranes or within chromatographic systems. In cells, anion exchangers are crucial for maintaining ionic balance, pH regulation, and the transport of metabolites. In biotechnology, synthetic anion exchangers are used for the purification and separation of biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, anion exchangers are studied for their roles in neural signaling, synaptic transmission, and the regulation of brain extracellular environment. In biotechnology, anion exchange chromatography is a standard technique for purifying proteins, antibodies, and nucleic acids. Advances in material science and protein engineering are leading to the development of more selective, efficient, and robust anion exchangers for research, clinical, and industrial applications. Understanding anion exchanger function is also important for the design of biosensors, drug delivery systems, and diagnostic devices.</p>
