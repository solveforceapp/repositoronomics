      <h1>Bank</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology and neurotechnology, the term "bank" most commonly refers to a biological repository or storage facility designed to preserve and catalog biological samples, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, tissues, cells, or even entire organs. Biobanks are critical infrastructures that enable the systematic collection, processing, storage, and distribution of biological materials for research, clinical, and therapeutic purposes. These banks maintain strict protocols for sample quality, traceability, and data management, ensuring that specimens remain viable and their associated metadata is accurately recorded. In neurotechnology, brain banks specifically focus on the preservation of neural tissue, often from donors with neurological diseases, to facilitate research into brain structure, function, and pathology. The concept of a bank in this context extends to digital repositories as well, where large datasets—such as genomic sequences or brain imaging data—are securely stored and made accessible to the scientific community.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Biological banks play a transformative role in advancing biotechnology and neurotechnology. In biotechnology, biobanks support large-scale studies in genomics, proteomics, and personalized medicine by providing high-quality, well-characterized samples for analysis. They enable researchers to identify genetic markers for disease, develop targeted therapies, and validate diagnostic tools. In neurotechnology, brain banks are invaluable for studying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS, as they provide access to post-mortem brain tissue from affected and control individuals. This facilitates the discovery of disease mechanisms, biomarkers, and potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, cell banks are essential for regenerative medicine, supplying stem cells and differentiated cell types for transplantation, drug screening, and tissue engineering. The integration of biobanking with advanced data management systems and ethical frameworks ensures that samples and data are used responsibly, maximizing their impact on scientific discovery and clinical innovation. As biotechnology and neurotechnology continue to evolve, the role of banks—both biological and digital—will only grow in importance, driving progress in research, healthcare, and the development of novel therapies.</p>
