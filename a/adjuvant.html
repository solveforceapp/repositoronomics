      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An adjuvant is a substance added to vaccines or drugs to enhance the body's immune response to an antigen. Adjuvants can be derived from microbial, mineral, or synthetic sources and work by stimulating the immune system, prolonging antigen exposure, or promoting the recruitment of immune cells. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, adjuvants are critical for the development of effective vaccines, immunotherapies, and treatments for infectious and neurological diseases.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Adjuvants are used in vaccines to increase efficacy, reduce the required dose, and improve protection against pathogens. In neurotechnology, adjuvants are explored for their potential to modulate neuroinflammation and enhance the delivery of therapeutics to the brain. Research into adjuvant mechanisms informs the design of next-generation vaccines and immunotherapies for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Advances in nanotechnology and biomaterials are expanding the range of adjuvants available for clinical and research applications.</p>
