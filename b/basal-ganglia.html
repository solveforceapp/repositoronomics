    <h1>Basal Ganglia</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected nuclei located deep within the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. They play a crucial role in the regulation of voluntary movement, motor learning, procedural memory, and reward processing. The basal ganglia include structures such as the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In neurotechnology, the basal ganglia are studied for their involvement in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the basal ganglia is used to treat these conditions. In biotechnology, research on the basal ganglia informs the development of therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders, addiction, and cognitive enhancement. Advances in neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and computational modeling continue to expand our understanding and manipulation of basal ganglia function in health and disease.</p>
