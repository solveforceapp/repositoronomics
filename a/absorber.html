      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>An absorber is a material or device designed to capture and dissipate energy, particles, or radiation from its environment. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, absorbers are used to shield sensitive equipment, protect biological samples, or control exposure to electromagnetic, ionizing, or acoustic energy. The effectiveness of an absorber depends on its composition, thickness, and the type of energy it is intended to absorb. Common absorbers include lead for X-rays, polymers for sound, and specialized coatings for light or heat.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, absorbers are used in laboratory safety equipment, such as radiation shields, biosafety cabinets, and protective clothing. In neurotechnology, absorbers are critical for shielding neural implants, imaging devices, and experimental setups from unwanted interference or damage. The development of advanced absorber materials, including nanocomposites and metamaterials, has enabled more effective protection and control of energy in research and clinical environments. Proper use of absorbers ensures the safety, accuracy, and reliability of experiments and medical procedures involving sensitive biological or electronic systems.</p>
