    <h1>Extranet Access</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Extranet access refers to the controlled ability for external users, such as business partners, vendors, or clients, to connect to a company’s private network. Unlike an intranet, which is strictly internal, an extranet provides selective access to non-employees, typically through secure authentication and encrypted connections. This access is often limited to specific resources, applications, or data necessary for collaboration, while maintaining the security and integrity of the core internal network.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Extranet access is widely used in supply chain management, joint ventures, and customer portals. For example, a manufacturer may grant suppliers access to inventory systems to streamline ordering and logistics. In IT and cybersecurity, extranet access is managed with firewalls, VPNs, and strict access controls to ensure that only authorized external parties can reach designated resources, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized activity.</p>
