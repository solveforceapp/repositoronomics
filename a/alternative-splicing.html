    <h1>Alternative Splicing</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Alternative splicing is a process by which different combinations of exons are joined together during the processing of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), resulting in the production of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. This mechanism greatly increases the diversity of the proteome and allows for tissue-specific, developmental, and regulatory control of gene expression in biotechnology and neurotechnology.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, alternative splicing is studied to understand gene regulation, identify disease-associated variants, and develop targeted therapies. In neurotechnology, alternative splicing plays a critical role in neural development, synaptic function, and the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Techniques such as RNA sequencing, CRISPR gene editing, and bioinformatics are used to analyze and manipulate alternative splicing for research and clinical applications. Advances in this field continue to reveal new opportunities for personalized medicine and therapeutic intervention.</p>
