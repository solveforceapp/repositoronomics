      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Azospirillum is a genus of nitrogen-fixing bacteria commonly found in the rhizosphere of grasses and cereals. These bacteria form beneficial associations with plant roots, promoting growth by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, producing phytohormones, and enhancing nutrient uptake. In biotechnology and neurotechnology, Azospirillum is studied for its role in sustainable agriculture, plant-microbe interactions, and the development of biofertilizers.</p>

      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>In biotechnology, Azospirillum is used to develop biofertilizers that improve crop yields, reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, and promote sustainable agriculture. Research into Azospirillum-plant interactions informs the design of microbial consortia for soil health and productivity. In neurotechnology, Azospirillum serves as a model for studying microbial signaling, communication, and the impact of microbiomes on brain function. Advances in genomics, synthetic biology, and systems biology continue to expand the applications of Azospirillum in agriculture, environmental management, and research.</p>
