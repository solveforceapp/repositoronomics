      <h1>Authorization</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Authorization is a critical security process that determines what actions, resources, or services an authenticated user, device, or system is permitted to access within an IT, telecom, or cloud environment. While authentication answers the question “Who are you?”, authorization answers “What are you allowed to do?” Authorization policies are enforced after successful authentication and are based on predefined rules, roles, or attributes. Common models include discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), role-based access control (RBAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC). These models define permissions at various levels of granularity, from individual files and applications to entire networks or cloud resources. Authorization is essential for enforcing the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and systems have only the access necessary to perform their functions, thereby reducing the risk of accidental or malicious misuse.</p>
      <h2>Application</h2>
      <p>Authorization is implemented in virtually every secure system, from enterprise IT networks and telecom infrastructure to cloud platforms and SaaS applications. For example, in a corporate environment, RBAC allows administrators to assign permissions based on job roles, so that a finance manager can access payroll data but not network configurations. In telecom, authorization controls which users can make international calls or access premium services. Cloud providers use policy-based authorization to manage access to virtual machines, storage, and APIs, supporting compliance with industry regulations and customer requirements. Fine-grained authorization is increasingly important in microservices and API-driven architectures, where each service may have its own access policies. Automated authorization systems can dynamically adjust permissions based on context, such as location, device, or risk level. By implementing robust authorization mechanisms, organizations can protect sensitive data, prevent privilege escalation, and maintain regulatory compliance in an ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>
